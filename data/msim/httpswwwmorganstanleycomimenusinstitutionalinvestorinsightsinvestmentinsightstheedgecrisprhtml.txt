 Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR is a new tool for genetic research that allows scientists to locate specific segments of DNA and then replace or delete those segments. It enables scientists to alter organisms for either therapeutic or research purposes both before and after they have developed. For investors it has the potential to birth new industries and disrupt existing medical treatments.

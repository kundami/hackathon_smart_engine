 Almost a year ago in May 2018 we discussed how U.S. value stocks were entering their twelfth year of underperformance compared with U.S. growth stocks. Value stocks in the U.S. had become much cheaper than normal compared to growth stocks and investor enthusiasm for growth stocks had been steadily building. But our conclusion was that a regime switch back to value from growth was not yet imminent and had another few quarters of underperformance ahead before the turning point as the macroeconomic conditions still favored growth stocks capital spending by growth companies was high but not yet excessive and investor enthusiasm for growth stocks was not yet euphoric.1

 Australia has indeed been a lucky country enjoying a 28 year stretch without an official recession.1 Employment has grown every year since 1994 corporate profits are at a record high and migration to the land down under has grown every year since 1990 by roughly 140 000 people.2 But cracks in the facade are beginning to appear. With ubiquitous prosperity cheap money and tax breaks for home owners and investors the Australian housing market had been on a record tear for nearly 30 years. After rising about 250% from 1989 to the early 2000 s similar to the U.S. Australian home prices then more than doubled by the end of 2017 even as U.S. home prices crashed and only recently recovered their mid 2000 highs . As a result Australia now sits on top of a housing bubble and as is usually the case on top of a credit bubble.

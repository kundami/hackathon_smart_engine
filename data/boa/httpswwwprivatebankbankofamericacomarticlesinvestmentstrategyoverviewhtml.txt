 A Rising Tide Leads to a Great er Divide Q A WITH CHRIS HYZY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER Chris how would you describe the current economic environment According to many market watchers we are in the late stages of the business cycle with a rising probability of a recession. That view is understandable after all more than a decade has passed since the economic collapse of 2008 and because typical cycles last only five or six years some economists think it is time. In addition others point to the slump in manufacturing activity or global trade and suggest growth is deteriorating. However rather than one long business cycle we believe there have been a series of mini waves and we are in the early to mid stages of the fourth mini wave since the Great Recession. Our view is largely based on current economic conditions many of which are not typical of a cycle s late stages historically.

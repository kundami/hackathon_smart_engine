      "Jimmy A Patel, MD & CEO, Quantum Mutual Fund, on the importance of ethics in financial advisory.\n",
      "Every industry has service providers. In the financial sector, the penetration of independent advisers for mutual fund businesses is low compared to insurance agents. ¬†This is primarily because of the stricter norms the mutual fund industry follows, which is for the welfare of investors.\n",
      "In contrast, investment advisers are like financial doctors who counsel investors in making prudent investment decisions. They don many hats - as an asset manager, financial planner, psychologist, and investment counsellor to service their clients‚Äô financial needs and help them achieve their financial goals.\n",
      "Several factors hinder the financial advisory business. Primarily, the mutual fund industry faces ethical issues because of situations like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, insurance products are sold as investment products\n",
      "Advisers catering only to high net worth clients\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all retail investors easily trust financial advisers because they are unable to distinguish between unscrupulous and ethical advice. Investors seek proficient financial advisers when they are looking forward to honest, ethical, and transparent advice.\n",
      "Douglas Adams, an English writer, humourist, and dramatist once said, ‚ÄúTo give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity.‚Äù\n",
      "So, if investors receive high-quality, valuable financial advice that‚Äôs aligned with their level of satisfaction and risk tolerance, they will begin to trust financial advisers. Trust can only be built on the foundation of integrity and perhaps, that‚Äôs the way for financial advisers to function as financial guardians.\n",
      "Moreover, it is very important for advisers to show effective relationship management skills in order to cultivate trust to retain clients and attract new ones through referrals, based on credibility in a shifting advisory space.\n",
      "And for that, ethics is the cornerstone of the financial advisory business.\n",
      "Being ethical benefits advisers in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "Earns respect and carves a niche for oneself\n",
      "When an adviser handles the clients‚Äô/investors‚Äô money with care they gain their trust and goodwill\n",
      "Will save the adviser from facing the wrath from employees, customers, and everyone else he/she happens to deal with\n",
      "Will help earn profits as ethics have a positive correlation with profitability for long-term success\n",
      "It promotes a healthy organisational culture\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the amount of competition in the industry today, with banks eyeing a share of the pie in the wealth management space, acquiring a larger piece of the pie and retaining it, is quite challenging. Everyone is claiming to provide the best advice, best service, and offering a delightful experience.\n",
      "So, how do independent financial advisers stand out and earn the respect and trust of clients?\n",
      "For IFAs to earn trust, placing the investor‚Äôs/ client‚Äôs interest first and following high fiduciary standards always is essential.\n",
      "‚ÄúTrust is one of the most written about and researched topics because many of us have been betrayed,‚Äù says David Bedrick, a practising psychologist.\n",
      "Cultivating trust is a time-consuming process. It cannot be built in a few days. Also, going beyond the purview of the law and acting morally in the best interest of clients will gain advisers trust and goodwill. So, beat the stereotype.\n",
      "Well, one of the ways of doing this is by providing prudent, unbiased, and ethical advice, wherein the interest of the investor/client is put at the fore at all times and their hard-earned money is handled with utmost care recognising their needs, risk profile, investment objectives, financial goals, and the time horizon before goals befall.\n",
      "This thoughtful approach can help IFAs gain the confidence of investors. And if they are handheld with empathy and care, render solution-oriented advice in their journey of wealth creation, it can be a win-win and earn loyalty, respect, and trust of investors/clients. They may even recommend the service to friends and family members and help IFAs build a business on goodwill.\n",
      "IFAs should refrain from pushing products, which can make clients uncomfortable. People do not like being sold; rather they like to make their own decisions to buy recommended services and products.\n",
      "Focus on building the trust of a prospective client by being a ‚Äúgood listener‚Äù. The more an adviser listens, the more he/she can focus on understanding the client‚Äôs requirements, doubts, risks, and goals.\n",
      "As an IFA, one needs to set clear expectations and explain to clients what he/she can offer. As their financial partner, the guidance coupled with the experience provided should add value to investors. Hence, ensure that from the beginning of the relationship, you as an adviser engage in a two-way, transparent, communication with your clients consistently and continually.\n",
      "Investors will be happy to entrust their investments with someone who not only understands their financial goals, but one who can meet their functional, emotional, and ethical needs.\n",
      "IFAs always need to ensure their clients' financial wellbeing. Therefore, understanding the client‚Äôs financial history, present circumstances, and their financial goals are equally important.\n",
      "Plus, setting realistic risk-return expectations from an investment avenue is a fundamental role IFAs play. Always be transparent as the role of the adviser has evolved from one of recommending products to one encompassing a more holistic approach and examining the client‚Äôs entire financial situation methodically. It will help the clients understand that there is no guarantee of success and their expectations will be reasonable.\n",
      "Also, IFAs must maintain the integrity and adopt the utmost care and diligence by always providing accurate information to the clients, helping them even during tough times, having additional support and backup staff, keeping up with the timelines in providing advice to clients, and responding to their queries promptly.\n",
      "Offering tools and calculators for online tracking of investments vide a portal and timely response with accurate information to their queries is perceived to be of immense value. Hence, offer value-add-ons to keep the clients‚Äô engaged and satisfied.\n",
      "And do take the time to assure clients that as their adviser, you will always do your best for their valued clients. In this way, there will be no place for dissatisfaction later. Clearly, state that you understand your responsibility towards your investor/client, and hence will provide periodic portfolio reviews and statements as well.\n",
      "Summing up\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For investors/clients to stick around for the long term, it is important for IFAs to build a relationship founded on integrity, ethics, and prudent business practices.\n",
      "Remember, building trust and gaining the respect of investors/clients is a process; IFAs need to earn their goodwill. It will not happen by chance; you have to consistently be there for them throughout their financial journey and make a conscious effort.\n",
      "To achieve this, as an IFA it is imperative for you to distinguish yourself from the crowd by standing for thoroughly researched, honest, unbiased, and ethical advice.\n",
      "As a credible adviser, to foster trust requires devoting time for clients initially. This will reap substantial¬†rewards for you in the form of higher client retention and referral rates in the long term.\n",

      "Asking key-phrases on '\n",
      "This article by Navneet Munot¬†originally appeared on CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor blog.\n",
      "The year 2019 is setting records and not the kind the planet would have liked. Not only will 2019 be among the hottest years ever recorded, but July 2019 was the hottest month in the 140 years that temperature records have been kept.\n",
      "The forest fires burning throughout the Amazon may have generated the headlines, but they are only a small sample of what is a global phenomenon. From Siberia to Canada, these conflagrations are becoming the new normal. And there are other worrisome signs, from melting glaciers to collapsing ice sheets, that demonstrate the planet‚Äôs climatic conditions have worsened considerably over the last few years.\n",
      "Climate change is for real, and in India, our challenge is particularly grave. The current and previous monsoon seasons may have been normal, or close to normal, but such categorizations don‚Äôt reflect the floods in Kerala and the mountain states or the droughts in Karnataka, parts of Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu all happening simultaneously.\n",
      "Nine of the 10 most-polluted cities in the world are Indian.¬†We are also among the top three nations when it comes to air pollution‚Äìrelated deaths. But the air quality is only one aspect of our climate change dilemma. Even if we solved our air pollution problem tomorrow, cities like Mumbai and Chennai would still be at risk from rising sea levels.\n",
      "And India isn‚Äôt alone in South Asia.¬†Indonesia‚Äôs president, Joko Widodo, has already announced the country‚Äôs capital will shift from Jakarta to a new site in East Kalimantan. The decision reflected economic considerations, but also acknowledged an uncomfortable reality: The city is sinking, with major floods occurring three times since 2002.\n",
      "The Indian water dilemma goes beyond rising seas. We are also in danger of becoming a water-stressed zone. The recent water crisis in Chennai ‚Äî¬†a city of millions running dry¬†‚Äî is symptomatic of the larger issue. The Indian government think tank¬†NITI Aayog¬†estimates that¬†21 major Indian cities will run out of groundwater in 2020, and many more will face drinking water shortages over the next decade. Add to that soil degradation and increased ocean acidification, and the challenge looms ever larger.\n",
      "For a developing, democratic nation like ours, one that suffers from poor literacy, weak human development, and rising inequality, we have to ask whether businesses in India will continue to enjoy the access to water resources that they have today.\n",
      "Indeed, India may be among the fastest-growing economies in the world, but our per capita income is just $2,000. As we climb up the income ladder, we consume more resources. We need to manage our resource consumption well if we are to make the path we are on a sustainable one.\n",
      "The world is taking action\n",
      "We would do well to heed the lessons of history. Like India, China enjoyed rapid economic growth as it expanded its manufacturing base amid high-resource consumption. This growth came with severe environmental consequences.¬†So the Chinese government adapted: It enacted the ‚ÄúBlue Sky‚Äù policy and imposed stricter environmental regulations.¬†And evidence suggests that it is working.\n",
      "And China isn‚Äôt an anomaly. Governments across the globe are starting to pay attention and take steps to counter climate change.\n",
      "To tackle air pollution, Europe has adopted stringent emission norms for passenger cars, resulting in a rapid scaling up of investments in electric vehicles.\n",
      "California continues to set the pace on emissions regulations, and its startup culture is working hard to keep up.\n",
      "India is implementing similar policy initiatives.¬†\n",
      "\n",
      "The transition to BS-VI emission norms, the equivalent to euro-VI, was fast-tracked, skipping the BS-V stage.\n",
      "A mix of taxation benefits, subsidies, and state fleets moving to electric vehicles has further propelled the shift toward cleaner automobiles.\n",
      "Maharashtra has banned single-use plastic.\n",
      "Delhi adopted an odd‚Äìeven plan for when private vehicles can be on the road.\n",
      "Karnataka closed plants around Bellandur Lake in response to rising pollution.\n",
      "In Tamil Nadu,¬†a large industrial plant was shut down because of environmental concerns.\n",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an ambitious goal of India becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2024¬†and has also made bold commitments on the environmental protection front to the global community.\n",
      "\n",
      "All such policy initiatives create both risks and opportunities for Indian corporates. These businesses may have had a free ride on environmental matters in the past, but today they ignore such issues at their own peril.\n",
      "What role do investors have to play? \n",
      "Historically, we‚Äôve focused on financial performance and corporate governance to mitigate risk and assess the potential for long-term value creation. That is no longer enough. Today, we owe a fiduciary duty to the community at large. Today, social and environmental concerns are at least as important as financial performance and governance. And our twin fiduciary duties, to our investors and to the larger community, are best served not by maximizing short-term profitability but by concentrating on returns and risks over the long term.\n",
      "At SBI Funds Management, as part of our fiduciary responsibility, value system, and risk-management strategy, it is our core belief that a business run in the best interests of all stakeholders seldom fails to create lasting value for its investors. We believe that companies that focus on the triple bottom line ‚Äî people, planet, and profits ‚Äî deliver sustained returns over an extended period. That‚Äôs why we integrated ESG factors into our investment decision-making process a few years ago. This means, apart from financial considerations, we look at the environmental footprint, social impact, and governance factors of our investee companies. We did not wait for our investors to ask us to take up the ESG mantle. We knew it was only a matter of time before they did.\n",
      "The logic behind all this is simple: Long-term sustainable growth requires a sustainable business and a sustainable environment. Adopting this logic creates a virtuous cycle: As investors focus on ESG, companies respond by integrating such considerations into their business practices.\n",
      "Globally, this cycle is gaining momentum. Large institutional investors ‚Äî pension funds and sovereign wealth funds ‚Äî have embraced ESG. And as climate change‚Äôs toll grows ever steeper and harder to deny, this momentum will increase further. Many institutions have already divested from fossil fuels. More will follow.\n",
      "What about returns? \n",
      "By screening out companies based on ESG data and limiting our investment universe, could we be shortchanging our clients? While reasonable, such concerns look to be overblown.¬†Ample and growing evidence from across the globe suggests ESG strategies deliver better-risk adjusted performance. Even in India, the NIFTY 100 ESG Index has outperformed the NIFTY 100 across time periods.\n",
      "As investors, we need to answer the climate change challenge and pull up our values-based socks. The need to integrate ESG considerations into investment analysis will only grow stronger. We have no choice. We owe it to the planet. We owe it to future generations.\n",

      "The fund recently saw a change in its mandate as well as leadership, and we think that the strategy is still coming together.\n",

      "Performance\n",
      "The fund underwent a change in mandate in May 2019.\n",
      "Following¬†the change in mandate, the fund is now being¬†anchored to its benchmark (IISL Nifty Large Mid¬†Cap 250 TR) and aims to have diversified exposure¬†across sectors. This change is designed to reduce¬†the volatility that stood out as a characteristic¬†of the fund in its previous avatar. Hence, it‚Äôs important to evaluate the fund‚Äôs performance under its new mandate and current managers.\n",
      "\n",
      "¬†Post the change, the fund showed a dip in performance when compared with the category average. This could be a short-term issue that reflects the transition period and it‚Äôs important to monitor how the fund does over a full market cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the periods prior to May 2019, a series of mediocre performances dented the fund‚Äôs long-term track record.\n",
      "Over a 5-year period (as of May 2019), the fund returned 10.60% (annualized) as opposed to the category, which returned 13.16%. This performance places the fund in the fourth quartile versus its peers. The fund underperformed on a 3-year basis, too, returning 9.81% versus its category peers, and fell in the fourth quartile during this period.\n",
      "Process\n",
      "Meenakshi Dawar and Sanjay Doshi ply a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy. They scout for firms with strong and sustainable business models and are flexible with valuations, given the company‚Äôs growth prospects.\n",
      "They tend to take a 2- to 3-year view on stocks and focus on factors such as return on equity and return on capital employed when evaluating companies.\n",
      "The research-orientation and qualitative overlay looks for companies with strong management teams, robust business models, and sustainable competitive advantages. The managers tend to buy into stocks based on the \"best fit\" for the portfolio based on its anchoring with the benchmark both at a stock and sector level. Further, they seek to mitigate risks by ensuring that they invest in high-quality names and keep a constant track of the firms they invest in.\n",
      "Having said that, it is imperative to point out that the portfolio is not devoid of risks--especially considering that it‚Äôs still a work in progress.¬†The recent change in the¬†fund‚Äôs mandate has led to some portfolio-level¬†changes, with the managers buying into benchmark¬†stocks with a view to align the fund to its¬†current mandate. The portfolio currently constitutes¬†around 55 odd holdings, with over 20 stocks¬†constituting the tail end of the portfolio and carrying¬†weights lower than 1%.\n",
      "The managers also focus on the top-down approach. Factors such as the interest-rate scenario, barriers to entry, pricing power, policy measures, and expected consumption/spending patterns are considered when investing. They use the internal model portfolio as an initial reference point while building the portfolio and consider analyst recommendations on this fund. The focus is on reducing volatility and building a stable long-term portfolio.\n",
      "The fund could be a good choice for investors who prefer a low-risk strategy with consistent returns. But do look at the execution of the strategy under its new mandate. \n",
      "Do read the brief analyst note¬†as well as look at the portfolio details.\n",

      "Asking key-phrases on '\n",
      "According to media reports, Tata Motors has approached China‚Äôs Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and BMW AG as it seeks partnerships for investing in electric vehicles.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Moody‚Äôs assigned a ‚ÄòBa3‚Äô rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors; the rating outlook is negative.\n",
      "RICHARD HILGERT, Senior Equity Analyst, admits that Tata Motors, India's largest commercial truck producer and owner of the Jaguar and Land Rover luxury brands, has hit a bumpy road. But is also convinced that the company is heading towards recovery.\n",
      "Here are his views on the fair value, the moat and what he believes is the company's future.\n",
      "Fair Value Estimate, FVE\n",
      "In the first half of CY2019, we recently lowered our FVE to Rs 465 from Rs 580 after rolling our model to the new fiscal year.\n",
      "The decrease was primarily due to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Increased financial leverage which resulted in an above average credit risk rating\n",
      "Change in capital structure resulted in an increase in our discount rate from 8.9% to 9.4%\n",
      "Assumption of revenue growth of 7.5%, well below the trailing 10-year average revenue growth rate of 14.0%\n",
      "5-year adjusted EBITDA margin forecast averages roughly 13.3%, 120 basis points better than the trailing 10-year average of approximately 12.1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "We took into consideration margin expansion from the Indian business as the domestic commercial vehicle market rebounds which were severally depressed from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2017 plus recovery in JLR China joint venture volume and profitability due to the launch of new models.\n",
      "During our 5-year forecast period, we estimate 5.9% JLR revenue growth in Indian rupees but only 4.8% in British pounds as the pound rebounds relative to the rupee. Our JLR volume growth assumption is 4% versus a 12.6% 10-year average, supported by continued demand recovery in Europe, recovering demand growth for luxury vehicles in China, and Brazil.\n",
      "We believe the global market for luxury passenger vehicles will continue to grow at a healthier pace than the lower-priced mass market, which we peg at 3% annualized growth.\n",
      "Morningstar's 2.25% long-term inflation outlook underpins our capital cost assumptions. Our assumed cost of equity is 14%, well above the 9% rate of return we expect investors will demand of a diversified equity portfolio. This incorporates above-average systematic risk and a 3-percentage-point India country risk premium. Our pretax cost of debt assumption is 8.0%, up from the prior model's 6.5%, incorporating a normalized long-term real rate environment while taking into account the spread creditors are likely to demand given Tata's credit risk.\n",
      "We use a 56% debt weighting to reflect the long-term capital structure of Tata, which has ranged between a low of 30% and high of 97%. Our long-run effective tax rate assumption is 27.5%, in line with the company's 10-year historical median. Consequently, our tax-affected weighted average cost of capital for Tata is 9.4%.\n",
      "Economic Moat\n",
      "Tata Motors' narrow economic moat rating is driven by the strength and global recognition of its Jaguar and Land Rover brands. Brand strength enables premium pricing that results in solid margins and healthy economic profits. The low-cost advantage enjoyed by its Indian business is driven by low labor costs and the local tax structure that favors domestic manufacturers.\n",
      "In our opinion, given capital intensity and lengthy product life cycles that a new startup would endure, it is more probable than not that Tata would maintain economic profitability for 10 years. Despite recent Jaguar Land Rover losses, the brand still enjoys premium pricing benefiting from its intangible asset moat source. However, for a mass-production luxury automotive brand, it is much more difficult to make the same claim about a 20-year period, during which, as management teams come and go and product turnover opens the possibility of a string of missteps, as is currently the case, the probability rises that the brand could destroy economic value for a period.\n",
      "Luxury, ultraluxury, and exotic brand automakers do not necessarily have an economic moat just because of brand strength and premium pricing. Even though Bentley (owned by Volkswagen) is globally recognized as an ultraluxury brand that commands a commensurate price, the automaker has experienced inconsistent volume and revenue growth, poor margin performance, profit volatility, and erratic economic profits during the past 10 years. In contrast, over the same time frame, wide-moat-rated exotic sports carmaker Ferrari has generated stable, consistent revenue growth, wide profit margins, and high returns corresponding with other wide-moat-rated stocks like Hermes, Richemont, and Vuitton. The main difference between the two is Ferrari‚Äôs rich Formula One racing heritage and its ability to leverage this heritage with the regular development and sale to select clientele of ultra-exclusive, multi-million-dollar, limited-edition (and sometimes completely unique one-offs), exotic super and hyper cars.\n",
      "While brands in these segments command high prices and are often purchased to make a personal statement, consumers can still easily switch to one of many competing products. Premium and luxury vehicle consumers can readily choose from brands like Acura, Alfa Romeo, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes, and Porsche. Ultra-luxury and exotic brands include Aston Martin, Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Lamborghini, Maserati (which is shifting to a lower-price higher-volume strategy), McLaren, Pagani, and Rolls-Royce. These vehicle consumers have the financial wherewithal to simply add more cars to their personal fleet if they so desire.\n",
      "However, based on Jaguar Land Rover's ability to price above mass-market models due to its brand strength, we think the luxury brands make a substantial contribution toward building Tata‚Äôs consolidated economic moat. Using just JLR financials, we estimate that over the past nine years, brand strength has enabled the group to average 6 percentage points of economic profit over an estimated 9.4% weighted average cost of capital.\n",
      "With new facilities in China, Slovakia, and Brazil, Jaguar Land Rover will have a manufacturing presence in the world's top seven automobile markets. Global volume growth in luxury segment vehicles is bolstered by an increasing population of upper-middle-class as well as roughly 15 million high-net-worth individuals with investable assets of $1 million or higher. We expect 1%-3% average annual growth in overall global automotive demand, but because of the increase in the world‚Äôs wealthy population, we think luxury vehicle segment demand will grow at average annual rate in excess of 3%. We believe JLR will continue to roll out new products that sustain its luxury brand image and premium pricing, supporting our narrow economic moat rating.\n",
      "Tata's domestic mass-market passenger vehicle and its commercial vehicle operations enjoy substantial growth potential and a low-cost manufacturing base. Global automobile manufacturers face a steep import duty in India ranging from 60% to 200% based on the price tag which, when coupled with insurance and domestic inland tax of 20%-30%, makes their products an unattractive option for domestic buyers. More than 40% depreciation in the Indian rupee over the past few years has further raised the prices for imported automobiles for the domestic market. In our view, this provides a competitive advantage to domestic manufacturers, including Tata Motors.\n",
      "More global automobile manufacturers may choose to set up manufacturing plants or assembly lines in India, which could give them a level playing field versus domestic manufacturers. Still, it takes at least two years to select a site, apply for government permits, receive various approvals, build a plant, and start vehicle production. Also, immediate market acceptance is not guaranteed and usually requires more than one model. In addition, we believe Tata's efforts to export its small car Nano to Asian countries supports favorable operating leverage in its low-cost India manufacturing base. Given the time it takes for competitors to establish a presence, and because Tata is already well positioned to benefit from volume growth, we think the company will enjoy a moat from its cost advantage for at least 10 years.\n",
      "The future\n",
      "Tata is positioned to gain from the continued growth in Indian automotive sales and the expansion of luxury markets in emerging economies, especially China. Still, the imperative remains for Tata to keep investing in new models across brands and vehicle platforms. The Tata brand also needs to improve on its ability to execute vehicles at world-class quality levels. While improving, some JLR products still suffer from perceived poor quality. Growing industry overcapacity and domestic competition, along with capital-intensive operations and the industry's cyclicality, pose serious challenges to Tata's ability to consistently earn returns above its cost of capital.\n",

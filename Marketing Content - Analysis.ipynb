      "Doc - Orig:  As we enter 2019 two specific challenges face the two largest economies in the world. First will U.S. financial markets have a soft bumpy or hard landing following the economic cycle peaks of growth and earnings that were reached in 2018 Second will stimulus policies in China stabilize growth conditions in the year ahead Resolutions for both will have significant global implications for economies and financial asset prices alike. These challenges are represented thematically as our Four C s for 2019 Caffeine Credit China and Chameleons. Caffeine Caffeine represents the fiscal boost the U.S. experienced from tax policy which led to an earnings and growth cycle that exceeded the expectations of many forecasters and catalyzed an appreciation in the U.S. dollar. We believe this caffeine boost wears off in 2019 leaving the economy to reconcile the fallout from the growth and earnings peaks reached in 2018. Simply put will the U.S. economy have a soft bumpy or hard landing Context is important. We believe that tax reform and deregulation spurred business investment and a capital deepening that catalyzed a reversal in the falling trend in productivity. The rise in productivity may have a longer lasting impact that may lead to higher potential growth. The initial impulse was recorded in 2018 with U.S. gross domestic product GDP growing at 3% versus original consensus estimates of around 2% which proved too low. Consensus expectations is for full year growth to slow to 2.6% in 2019 however on a 12 month rolling basis 4Q19 4Q18 growth is expected to trough at 1.7% a level we think is about equal to potential growth. Full year growth is expected to then be 2.2% for 2020. What comes next is the key. If the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed engineers a soft landing and growth temporarily falls only to potential then we think this will produce a positive outcome for financial assets. This is the soft landing scenario. If the slowdown in growth slows to levels slightly below potential and is perceived as transitory lasting only a few quarters before resuming above 2% growth we consider this a bumpy landing. However if growth levels fall below potential for what the market perceives to be an extended period that may include a recession this is the hard landing scenario. Of course the Fed is likely to ease policy in the hard landing scenario and possibly even the bumpy one. Which scenario comes to pass will be very dependent on how inflation evolves. If inflation remains well behaved meaning rising gently or maybe not at all probabilities of a soft or bumpy landing rise significantly. Credit Credit asset performance will be impacted by post peak dynamics in growth and earnings. It needs to be recognized that this asset class is especially vulnerable due to high levels of leverage in the post quantitative easing QE era. Although a recession is not our base case scenario in the next couple of years risk premia has risen and will likely rise further adjusting spreads wider to reflect the increased weighting of this risk. But this also assumes static behavior in the corporate sector. We should not assume solidly performing companies will do nothing if credit conditions deteriorate further. How soon how deep and how long a slowdown might materialize are therefore questions that need to be reconciled. The credit cycle is intricately linked to how Fed policy will influence the economic landing in the post peak growth and earnings period. Investment grade credit is particularly sensitive to this given the increased level of leverage in the aftermath of QE policies. A simple somewhat oversimplified rule of thumb might be that the landing is expected to be soft if the Fed ends the cycle with policy rates at 3% or less bumpy from 3% to 3.5% and hard if above 3.5%. Market concerns seem skewed to the worst case scenario Display 1 . Display 1 Markets Are Over Anxious to Price the End of the Cycle Source Google. Date as of October 31 2018 China China policy has significant influence on the global economic cycle. China had been tightening policy considerably in 2017 through mid 2018. In 2017 China increased short rates by over 200 basis points bps as measured by one month fixings on the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate SHIBOR and the yuan rose over 7% all of which represented a significant tightening of policy. The impact on the Chinese economy was perhaps felt more deeply in 2018 due to a deterioration in U.S. China trade relations. In response China has engaged in aggressive easing with stimulus polices such as reducing the same SHIBOR by more than 200 bps in 2018 and required reserve ratio RRR cuts of 250 bps. Additionally Beijing has eased lending standards for banks and is expected to expand government borrowing by as much as 3% of GDP which amounts to approximately $400 billion in dollar terms.1 We are already seeing early signs of stimulus working to stabilize asset prices. Since easing policies tend to lag we may see further stability and possibly even a rebound in 2019 which will be supportive of global asset prices especially but not only confined to emerging markets. Chameleon Chameleon refers to the need to have flexibility to be nimble and change as different investment opportunities may arise as we learn more about the post peak growth and earnings period. It is not yet clear whether the market will experience a soft bumpy or hard landing post the peak. Asset prices are incorporating this uncertainty as we speak and adjusting risk premia accordingly higher. Serving as our base case scenario we interpret the recent volatility in the market as a mid to late cycle reset not an end of cycle hard landing. For the sake of simplicity and clarity our outlook is in favor of a soft to bumpy landing scenario. Implicit in our base case is that the Fed will be responsive to a tightening of financial conditions namely in the form of higher interest rates a strengthening of the U.S. dollar wider credit spreads and weaker equity prices. Perhaps it took the market to acknowledge that the peak in growth and earnings was behind it to respond to rising policy rates. The Fed is finally getting the tightening they were aiming for the key for them is not to overdo it by overtightening and creating a policy error that might lead to a hard landing. Our bet is that they will not make this mistake. It is therefore likely that the market may also acknowledge that the peak in the U.S. Treasury 10 year yield is destined to stay below 3.50%. In this scenario money flows away from the U.S. dollar as peak earnings have passed and growth differentials between the U.S. and the rest of the world narrow. These will be the first steps to ease financial conditions and with that occurring money may be attracted to assets that have sold off well beyond their fundamental valuations Display 2 . However we are likely to have to be patient as this may not occur until mid 2019 or later. Emerging markets stand out as an asset class that has sold off extensively beyond fundamental valuations. High yield and investment grade credit also generated greater than expected losses and the U.S. dollar which gained so much in 2018 stands to reverse course in the year ahead. We expect interest rates to remain largely in a benign range bound environment though we expect investment opportunities to be idiosyncratic driven by extreme misvaluations relative to economic fundamentals. We believe these idiosyncratic opportunities can be best taken advantage of by active and flexible strategy mandates. Given all of the risks facing the world some of which could easily come to pass we do not see 2019 as producing systematic index opportunities that favor passive investment strategies. Having a diversified flexible chameleon like approach capable of adapting to the world s zigs and zags is in our opinion more likely to produce superior investment results in 2019.

Date as of October 31 2018 Conclusion Be prepared to be flexible and ready to adapt in 2019. Market uncertainty revolves around determining whether or not the end of the Fed tightening cycle will produce a soft bumpy or hard landing whether or not China s stimulus policies enacted in 2018 and likely continuing into 2019 will stabilize their economy in 2019. Additional considerations reside with Europe and BREXIT political risks that are difficult to value. Risk premia is on the rise and consequently pushing asset prices below fundamental valuations in a non uniform manner. The investment opportunities reside in idiosyncratic factors within each country sector security where misvaluations in price relative to fundamentals are greatest. Flexible nimble and active management of strategies may be most effective in the year ahead. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The short term funding market landscape continues to evolve. While 2018 was a year characterized by the Federal Reserve methodically hiking rates we expect 2019 will be different. As rates continue to rise the end of the rate tightening cycle could be in sight. There are a number of factors impacting the front end markets but we believe monetary policy decisions will have the most direct impact. This will be carried out broadly by interest rate policy and Federal Reserve balance sheet normalization. KEY THEMES IN 2019 The market will seek to understand the true definition of the neutral policy rate and the path towards that rate. Monetary policy is likely to continue to tighten through gradual rate hikes and balance sheet normalization. Liquidity yields are much more attractive and opportunities may arise if market and Fed expectations are not aligned. Interest Rate Policy The market debate entering the new year will likely be centered on the neutral rate or stance of monetary policy that is neither accommodative nor restrictive. While much theoretical work has been done to estimate the neutral rate challenges remain because the estimates are imprecise and complicated by other factors including both short term fiscal stimulus and long term factors productivity growth and regulatory policy . In the fourth quarter of 2018 we heard Fed Chairman Jerome Powell describe interest rates as both far below neutral and just below the broad range of estimates for neutral which while seemingly contradictory highlights the challenges of trying to predict the neutral rate. Rather than thinking of the neutral rate as a specific rate level Chairman Powell prefers to think of neutral as a range of rates which is currently believed to be between 2.5% 3.5%. Given this view it is likely that we will enter 2019 very close to the lower end of the range. A range this large presents some challenges to the market. On one hand we are nearly within the neutral policy setting. But on the other hand we would still be neatly within that range following four additional rate hikes. Market perception is that once the fed funds rate approaches neutral the decision framework for further rate hikes could change. The decision to hike rates beyond the neutral setting will be more of a data dependent framework due in part to risks discussed later in this piece. Due to this belief the market is discounting the Fed s current expectations of three rate hikes in 2019. Will strong growth employment and inflation data warrant moving policy into a restrictive mode In addition given the expected further rate hikes the interest rate curve could continue flattening or inverting to a point where it could pressure financial conditions which is a key metric that the Fed considers when analyzing data and economic indicators. On top of all of this the Fed s commitment to greater transparency means that starting in 2019 there will be a press conference following every Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting. This doubles the amount of meetings that the market perceives as live where an interest rate hike or major policy action could be announced. This change along with the aforementioned dynamics is creating uncertainty for the future path of interest rates and how portfolios need to be managed in response. Display 1 Fed and Market Interest Rate Projections Data as of November 25 2018. Source Morgan Stanley Research. Forecasts estimates are based on current market conditions subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass. Balance Sheet Normalization Normalizing monetary policy is coming from more than just rising interest rates. Due to quantitative easing conducted during the global financial crisis the Fed s balance sheet ballooned to a peak of $4.5 trillion.1 Due to the FOMC s balance sheet normalization program the size of the balance sheet has decreased by $400 billion as of November 2018.1 Balance sheet run off is now up to a maximum of $50 billion per month. When normalization began in October 2017 former Fed Chair Janet Yellen hoped the program would be similar to watching paint dry. While it could be argued that the market impact has been minimal thus far as the balance sheet unwind continues potential supply and demand pressures will mount. If this happens it could lead to wider spreads and higher yields in the short term fixed income market. Risks to the Outlook In addition to the uncertainties surrounding Fed policy and balance sheet normalization 2019 is shaping up to have a host of factors that could introduce risk into the global economy. These risks span the globe and arise from a myriad of sources. In the U.S. key questions center on the handling of the impending debt ceiling and slowing growth due to fading fiscal stimulus. Globally cross currents in the market stem from uncertain trade policy and broader geopolitical concerns. Finally we are beginning to see cracks forming in the credit market with headline risk from the BBB leveraged loan and high yield markets. It is difficult to tell which of these factors might impact the markets or our outlook on monetary policy in 2019 but they are worth monitoring closely as we move into the new year. Liquidity Markets Poised to Build on 2018 Momentum With the renewed volatility in the global markets paired with rising rates short term investments are becoming a more meaningful part of asset allocation plans. Many cash yields are now in excess of inflation and the S P 500 dividend yield. This means that your liquid investments can be accretive for the first time in years. Gradual rate hikes are likely to continue this trend in 2019. Many investors take comfort in highly liquid short duration investments amid rising rates. This strategy was rewarded in 2018 as short term benchmarks broadly outperformed their longer duration counterparts. While the tide of Fed policy may be shifting short term fixed income investments will likely continue to be an important part of investors portfolios by providing liquidity and helping to minimize interest rate risk in these uncertain times. Across our portfolios we will continue to focus on the key objectives of capital preservation and liquidity while opportunistically taking advantage of attractive risk adjusted returns that present themselves in the market. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As the third quarter unfolded it was hard to ignore the magnitude and velocity of changes taking place for traditional assets. Investors navigated an early quarter risk rally fueled by a preemptive U.S. rate hike that was later offset by escalating U.S. China trade tensions. Fears of a U.S. slowdown mounted and global markets sold off in mid August with yields on the U.S. Treasury 10 year bonds falling to 1.5% by month end.1 The year to date results of a traditional 60 40 S P 500 and UST 10Y portfolio surged in August approaching post crisis highs and finished the quarter by rewarding a high level of dependency on negative stock bond correlation and passive beta exposure. Display 1 Display 1 Strong YTD Performance Across US Equities and Rates Source Bloomberg Morgan Stanley Research October 2019 However during a two week period in September one of the most violent growth value factor rotations on record took place beneath the market s surface 2 affecting many equity oriented hedge funds. And later in the month borrowing through repurchase agreements repo signaled funding stress. Rates surged to 10% as general collateral supporting those loans cheapened versus borrowing costs of overnight index swaps raising concerns for leveraged strategies.3 Throughout the turmoil of the third quarter the HFRI Fund Weighted Hedge Fund Index declined 49 basis points. Display 2 Gains generated by macro and relative value managers could not offset the negative impact from the equity oriented and high yield strategies. Nevertheless overall hedge fund results remained strong for the year to date period returning 6.7%. All strategies contributed to performance and many helped to mitigate risk even as volatility continued to pick up in the equity fixed income and commodities markets. Display 2 Q3 and YTD 2019 Returns of Hedge Fund Indices Source www.hedgefundresearch.com as of September 30 2019 On the positive side macro managers returned 2.5% amid the August turbulence capitalizing on the duration rally front end curve exposures and long U.S. dollar trades. Display 3 Systematic and discretionary macro managers demonstrated low equity correlations benefiting from meaningful rises in realized and implied volatility in equity and fixed income and to a lesser degree spikes in crude oil. If the trajectory of global correlations continues to rise they jumped in August we believe managers employing more convex or more nuanced and tailored trade expressions may be more likely to outperform those using basic delta one or linear approaches. Only the surprise outcome of Argentina s August 11th primary election whereupon all of the country s equity sovereign credit and currencies plunged detracted meaningfully from returns of emerging markets focused managers who had enjoyed strong performance going into the summer. Display 3 Q3 2019 Monthly Returns of Hedge Fund Indices Source www.hedgefundresearch.com as of September 30 2019 In general equity long short managers were the laggards in the third quarter. An acute growth value and momentum style factor rotation in August and extreme movements in the U.S. during the second week of September caused one of the worst months for alpha production since 2010 according to Morgan Stanley Prime Brokerage4. Display 4 Dissimilar to other factor unwind periods in which managers longs were particularly hard hit in this de risking episode short positions did little to offset those losses. Furthermore larger managers tended to have higher exposures to the more crowded names than smaller managers did but managers unilaterally decreased gross and net exposure levels during the second half of September. Display 4 Factor Performance Source language beneath the chart with the following Goldman Sachs Portfolio Strategy Research US Macroscope Five Questions and Answers on the Momentum Reversal 11 September 2019 Unlike prior sell offs this decline was orderly. Managers actively sold longs while adding shorts rotating out of healthcare biotech and software and covering energy materials autos and retail. As a whole quantitative multi manager platforms and low net high gross long short managers worked out of their September deficits to finish the month modestly negative. On the other hand many stock picking generalists who are less factor aware and tend to rely on equity beta posted surprisingly negative results during a month in which equity markets ended generally up. Conclusion Today s environment appears fragile with heavy volatility selling yield chasing and risk embracing behavior affecting 3Q performance. We foresee volatility increasing as episodes of geopolitical friction monetary policy errors and liquidity holes start to coincide with economic and late cycle fundamentals. While the strong risk markets have been punctuated by brief sell offs the level of comfort and performance afforded by a 60 40 portfolio appears less certain today. As investors begin to focus on risk mitigation and sources of non correlated return we believe hedge fund solutions can serve as a valuable component of a well constructed portfolio. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Alternative risk premia ARP represent the potential reward to investors for taking on specific types of risk. As the name suggests these risks are alternative to traditional market risks in the sense that they tend to be structured as long short investments and if carefully selected tend not to correlate highly with traditional asset classes. In fact many ARP seek to be market neutral while others seek to act as traditional market risk mitigators. Both may be appealing to investors concerned about the potential for a future market downturn. What Are ARP ARP are factor based sources of return that are rules based and systematically derived. By factor based we mean that ARP represent specific factor exposures such as value momentum carry and volatility. They can be asset classspecific or multi asset and they can span geographies. ARP have the flexibility to invest long or short in instruments such as but not limited to stocks bonds money market treasuries currencies commodities and options. By rules based we mean that ARP are designed with specific rules governing investment strategy investment universe frequency of trading and amounts traded for example. Once these rules have been established trading is done systematically without portfolio manager intervention. For all of these reasons ARP as a group tend to exhibit heterogeneous characteristics. A Complementary All Weather Portfolio Allocation Introducing alternative risk premia to a portfolio that includes traditional market betas and or other relative return based strategies could offer a number of potential benefits DIVERSIFICATION 1 Source of absolute return with potential for low correlation to stocks bonds and other assets CONTROL Transparent and targeted means of addressing gaps and concentrations in existing factor exposures LIQUIDITY With daily liquidity potential to increase a portfolio s ability to adapt to changing markets without significant cost FEE OPTIMIZATION Systematic exposure to alternative strategies at potentially lower cost than available through active managers Considering the above characteristics one can see that ARP strategies have the potential to be powerful portfolio construction and optimization tools. Performance During Sideways and Down Markets If included as part of a broader asset allocation we believe ARP strategies have the potential to play a valuable role over the long term removing some of the path dependency to which a portfolio comprised solely of traditional asset classes can be exposed. ARP have the potential to generate returns that are unaffected by market movements and in some cases actually move counter to traditional markets. An analysis of ARP strategy behavior in different market scenarios explains why this is the case. We can assess the historical behavior of various ARPs using a measure that is based on the differential between equity and rates performance. Higher historical equity performance suggests a risk on environment while higher fixed income returns reflect risk off sentiment. Display 1 With this data we can compare how various ARPs behave in different circumstances with those most closely related to higher equity returns being more risk seeking and those with more contrarian characteristics being potentially more defensive. Understanding these dynamics may allow investors to make decisions about how to incorporate complementary allocations of ARP to portfolios that are heavily allocated to traditional asset classes. DISPLAY 1 Performance of Representative ARP in a Range of Risk On and Risk Off Environments Source AIP Hedge Fund Team and Bloomberg. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Below we highlight a small subset of these strategies that may be attractive as we face the increased risk of flat markets or market declines A Market Neutral Rates Carry risk premia strategy invests long in bonds with the highest yields and short bonds with the lowest yields. Designed appropriately the excess returns from interest rate carry are countercyclical in nature with excess returns of deferred money market futures contracts approximately three to five times higher in recessions than the non recession average. DISPLAY 2 Market Neutral Rates Carry Annualized Return 07 2001 08 2019 Source AIP Hedge Fund Team and Bloomberg. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An Equity Quality risk premia strategy invests in stocks with the highest profitability and earnings efficiency in a given category while shorting the least profitable and least efficient stocks in that same category. Here the idea is to buy assets that show strong earnings certainty and sell assets that appear less profitable. Quality is a relatively new risk premia factor but it has been incorporated in ARP portfolios for its defensive positioning characteristics. The countercyclical nature of quality factors means that they can be used to hedge broad equity exposure. DISPLAY 3 Equity Quality Annualized Return 07 2001 08 2019 An Equity Low Volatility risk premia strategy invests in stocks with the lowest volatility in a given group and shorts those stocks with highest volatility in the same group. Low volatility has produced significant alpha over the past few decades. And historically the performance of low volatility has declined less than the market during downturns.2 The outperformance of low volatility stocks somewhat contradicts the Capital Asset Pricing Model s assumption that higher risk is compensated with higher return leading people to refer to this trend as the Low Volatility Anomaly. The return associated with this risk premium has been explained as follows Many investors seek to outperform benchmarks through holding higher risk stocks resulting in relatively underpriced low volatility stocks. 3 As such we would define this strategy as somewhat contrarian. DISPLAY 4 Equity Low Volatility Annualized Return 07 2001 08 2019 Source AIP Hedge Fund Team and Bloomberg. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An FX Value risk premia strategy seeks to capitalize on the mean reversion of prices to their equilibrium price based on the premise that prices temporarily deviate because of investor behavior e.g. overreaction or herding mentality or liquidity effects e.g. temporary market shocks or supply demand friction .4 With regard to currencies the idea is that misaligned exchange rates should adjust to their equilibrium rates over the long term. That is exchange rates that are overvalued relative to equilibrium will depreciate and vice versa. The correlation between FX value and equity bond betas have historically been either negative or close to zero suggesting the strategy may provide some useful diversification benefits to a portfolio largely comprised of traditional asset classes.

It Can Be Complicated Interestingly some of the same characteristics that make it compelling to invest in ARP strategies also make it more challenging to do so. For instance since ARP do not track conventional market movements which have generally been upward sloping they can generate lower absolute returns than traditional markets in some scenarios. It is worth highlighting however that unlike pure alternative hedging strategies for which you pay a premium for insurance that translates to negative carry ARP have the potential to generate positive carry even when markets are going up. ARP returns are not normally distributed and have the potential to provide returns complementary to traditional markets providing hedging and diversification benefits when implemented appropriately. However this also means that it can be challenging to apply conventional asset allocation methodologies to these ARP strategies without requisite expertise. Another consideration is that there are no set industry rules governing how ARP are designed. In other words ARPs with similar names such as Equity Quality may have been designed very differently by different providers and thus may have dramatically different return profiles. For this reason ARP investing requires extensive evaluation record keeping and coverage things not all investors may wish to carry out on their own. These are just two examples of why we believe it s important for investors to consider partnering with a fiduciary who can help them evaluate ARP strategies for inclusion in a broader asset allocation mix effectively. Conclusion Investors search for differentiated exposures and uncorrelated sources of return takes on new urgency against a backdrop of potentially weaker future market returns. Bonds have historically been a safe haven of positive yield in times of negative equity returns. However with rates decreasing globally and in many cases turning negative bonds are not generating much if any yield. In other words bonds may not be able to generate sufficient returns and the same level of portfolio protection today that they have historically. As such it may be worth considering ARP which have the potential to mitigate downside risk while in many cases still generating positive returns in a liquid and cost efficient way. 1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. 2 Alighanbari Doole and Shankar.

      "Doc - Orig:  As investors grapple with the portfolio implications of a low interest rate environment alongside a continuing search for yield alternative lending may offer attractive absolute and risk adjusted return characteristics. An allocation to alternative lending may provide investors with exposure to a secular shift in the way consumers and small businesses access capital. In this paper we provide insights on this nascent asset class. What Is Alternative Lending Alternative lending is an asset class born of bank disintermediation and technological innovation. Alternately referred to as marketplace lending peer to peer lending and P2P lending alternative lending takes place through online platforms that use technology to bring together borrowers who are underserved by traditional lending institutions and loan investors who seek attractive yield generating investments. The lending model grew out of small balance peer to peer unsecured consumer loans financed by retail investors. As volumes ramped and the asset class matured alternative lending evolved such that most loans are funded today by institutional investors.1 At the same time the types of credit risk underwritten by alternative lenders expanded beyond unsecured consumer to include small business lending student loans auto finance and other forms of specialty finance. Display 1 Alternative Lending Model How Does it Work Borrowers may seek alternative loans for a variety of reasons including for debt consolidation or to pay down revolving credit card balances. By moving from a revolving structure to an amortizing installment structure borrowers may benefit from a lower interest rate than would be charged on a comparable revolving balance such as from a credit card. Alternative lending platforms seek to streamline the traditional lending process by bringing borrowers and loan investors together and by using technology enabled models to rapidly underwrite borrower credit risk to determine appropriate loan pricing terms and amounts offered to borrowers. When borrowers accept loan offers investors may purchase the loans post issuance either by actively selecting loans that they wish to purchase or by taking passive pro rata2 allocations of loans that meet prespecified criteria with respect to loan type size term duration credit risk geographic concentration etc. Investors largely obtain the potential economic benefits and risks stemming from the loans but the platforms typically maintain the customer relationship with end borrowers and act as servicers for the loans sending cash flows from the borrowers to the investors net of servicing fees. The platforms also may charge loan origination fees typically to the borrowers. Platforms may use partner banks to formally originate the loans that they underwrite. The partner banks typically conduct oversight on the platforms underwriting models and ensure that underwritten loans and servicing procedures comply with applicable laws. In some cases the partner banks or platforms may maintain an economic interest in loans sold to investors. The loans themselves generally have relatively low initial balances on the order of $1 000 $40 000. Today the most common consumer unsecured alternative loan is fully amortizing with a weighted average term2 of 48 months and an average original principal of roughly $15 000.3 The Evolution of Alternative Lending4 Alternative lending grew rapidly in the decade following the first peer to peer online loans underwritten in the U.K. in 2005 and in the U.S. in 2006 gathering pace in the wake of the global financial crisis. These small volume credit experiments leveraged marketplace models alongside technology enabled customer acquisition underwriting and loan servicing geared to borrowers that had grown comfortable with online services. Alternative lending volumes scaled as the credit crisis drove bank retrenchment from consumer and small business lending and as new regulations increased the cost of capital for traditional banks stressing the traditional banking model. To facilitate burgeoning loan volumes alternative lending platforms evolved their funding models from the original peer to peer format to institutional buyers serving as the predominant loan investors purchasing portfolios of loans in bulk. Hedge funds were early buyers actively selecting individual loans that they expected would outperform the platform s average underwriting. As the platform underwriting models matured and the opportunities for hedge fund alpha5 generation declined institutional buyers largely migrated to passive pro rata purchases of loans within each buyer s defined credit box. Passive pro rata allocations moved the diligence burden for loan purchasers from the individual small ticket loans to all the loans underwritten by a platform within a purchaser s defined credit box as well as to the platforms themselves. Passive allocations also facilitated deeper integration with the capital markets. The first securitization backed by unsecured consumer alternative loans occurred in 2013 and the first rated securitization of those loans followed in 2015. U.S. consumer and small business alternative lending platforms first listed their shares publicly in 2014. The first registered alternative lending fund launched in the U.S. in 2016. In 2018 Morgan Stanley estimated $17.7 billion of asset backed security issuance by the marketplace lending sector which implied that roughly one third of marketplace loans originated in the U.S. that year were securitized.6 Display 2 Evolution of Alternative Lending As illustrated below the U.S. market saw U.S. alternative lending volumes increase by roughly 4x from 2014 to 2017.7 In 2017 the consumer segment represented about 70% of U.S. alternative lending followed by roughly 19% in small business and 11% in specialty finance a variety of smaller verticals.7 The small business segment took some market share from the consumer segment between 2014 and 2017 a trend that may continue given the sizable small business market opportunity as well as banks struggling to underwrite small ticket business loans using processes that often are relatively antiquated and manual. Display 3 U.S. Loan Origination by Segment Source Reaching New Heights The 3rd Americas Alternative Finance Industry Report. Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. December 2018. Why Is the Opportunity Compelling Today In our view there are four main reasons why alternative lending may be a compelling strategy for investors. 1. Alternative lending may provide a potential combination of attractive yield and low duration that stands in sharp contrast to the traditional fixed income universe. Alternative lending s relatively low duration may reduce sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. One contributor to low duration is the amortizing structure typical of alternative loans which may facilitate vintage diversification that may be challenging to achieve with traditional fixed income that only repays principal at maturity. Furthermore alternative lending may offer outsized credit spreads 8 gross of any defaults and recoveries. While alternative loans often are unsecured meaning defaults typically will be higher and recoveries lower than with traditional fixed income we believe that alternative lending s outsized credit spreads may provide a cushion against principal loss should investors encounter a less benign economic environment than that experienced following the global financial crisis.

See the end of the presentation for index descriptions. 2. Unsecured consumer alternative lending historically has been diversifying versus other major asset classes including traditional fixed income. We believe that the relatively low historical correlation of unsecured consumer alternative lending to traditional fixed income has been supported by the underlying credit exposure which stems primarily from the consumer rather than from corporate or government credit exposure that generally dominates traditional fixed income allocations. Judiciously selected unsecured consumer alternative lending investments historically would have increased portfolio diversification and a portfolio s expected return per unit of risk Sharpe ratio .8 Display 5 Historical Correlations Through 3 31 2018 Past performance is not indicative of future loss.

Unsecured consumer alternative lending exhibited attractive absolute and risk adjusted returns over the life of the Orchard U.S. Consumer Marketplace Lending Index from January 2011 to March 2018. The returns from unsecured consumer alternative lending were slightly better than the returns generated by U.S. REITs and substantially better than the modest return of traditional fixed income over the same period. Furthermore unsecured consumer alternative lending posted positive returns during periods of market turmoil when other traditional asset classes struggled including the Double Dip recession risk period in 2011 the Taper Tantrum of 2013 Grexit concerns in 2015 the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and the February 2018 market dip. It should be noted that since a liquid secondary market with observable prices has not yet developed alternative lending typically uses mark to model valuation based on discounted expected cash flows which could dampen return volatility.9 Display 6 Risk Adjusted Returns vs. Traditional Asset Classes Equities are represented by S P 500 Total Return Index Fixed Income by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and REITs by MSCI U.S. REIT Index.

Orchard ceased publishing index returns after March 2018. Therefore no alternative lending proxy data is available after that date. See the end of the presentation for index descriptions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and we recognize that the economy was relatively benign in the time frame over which index level data was available for alternative lending. We believe that alternative lending returns which are relatively untested in an economic downturn may prove procyclical and would likely decline during more challenging economic periods. However we believe the significant credit spreads on offer from alternative lending may provide a cushion before principal losses and may position the asset class to perform admirably over a full economic cycle. 4. Alternative lending reflects a diversified opportunity set. Indeed the volume and variety of strategies have flourished in recent years providing multiple axes for diversification e.g. by loan segment credit quality geography security interest ticket size and duration . Display 7 Diversified Opportunity Set For illustrative purposes only. The statements above reflect the opinions and views of AIP Alternative Lending Group as of the date hereof and not as of any future date and will not be updated or supplemented. Conclusion We believe that alternative lending is here to stay. Indeed we expect its growth trajectory to continue reflecting the potential benefits of the asset class to both borrowers and investors. Positioning investors at the intersection of technology and finance alternative lending may provide diversified exposure to a secular shift in the way that consumers and small businesses access capital. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Modern Monetary Theory MMT represents a structural change in how we think about money inflation and asset prices. It is an increasingly popular narrative that is widely discussed in the markets today. While the current debate is immediately unlikely to have a significant impact on asset prices it has the potential to affect the future of economic policy in a way that may present longer term risks. As a basic breakdown of a complex topic MMT can be understood in basic form to be the opposite of fiscal austerity. Fiscal austerity is the notion that a country s deficit or rather its deficit GDP ratio matters. This ratio is akin to a default risk level. MMT by contrast suggests that the deficit GDP ratio is less important because as long as a country can print its own money it can pay off its debts in perpetuity and without problems. In this theory the creation of money by the government is what directs economic activity. In its original formulation in 1905 this was called chartalism from the Latin charta meaning token. While the first M in MMT stands for modern the theory is also referred to as neo chartalism by those with a taste for economic history. There is nothing modern about it. Under standard monetary policy the Fed uses interest rates to affect the value of money. Lower rates mean cheaper money and an accommodative policy while higher rates make money more expensive and lead to monetary tightening. By contrast under MMT the government would take over responsibility for the Fed s dual mandate of price stability inflation and full employment. It would change the value of money through a combination of the printing press and taxation. Printing more would direct economic activity easing and increased taxation would drain money out of the system tightening . In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. Yogi Berra In theory MMT can work. In practice it is very unlikely to. MMT is seeing a resurgence in popularity largely due to the belief that the global economy is in a liquidity trap i.e. that interest rate policy as a tool to stimulate the economy is broken. In a liquidity trap lower rates no matter how low will not stimulate growth will not spur economic activity and will not increase employment. One of the explanations of why MMT has gained so much attention lately is because it is a policy polemic for depressed times 1 and there is indeed some validity to the liquidity trap argument. Japan s 0% rate policy the ECB policy rates at 0.40% low real rates of growth secular stagnation and so on all act as cases in point. In situations like this the fiscal side of the economy needs to step up. Can MMT work As Yogi Berra eloquently explained In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. In theory MMT can work. In practice we believe it is very unlikely to. In theory economic activity can be controlled by politicians through fiscal spending if they spend when appropriate and reduce spending when appropriate much like the way the Fed hikes and cuts interest rates. In practice however politicians of any party tend to become drunk with the power of the printing press and tend to invest and spend in inefficient projects. This generally leads to inflation rising. Expectations of rising inflation due to MMT would have an impact on investing by potentially decreasing the value of cash flows in the future. The discount rate would thus be expected to rise and the present value of assets would fall. Financial assets which were inflated under QE would likely suffer but real assets could benefit. This would take time however. During the first few years of MMT the potential impact may be similar to that of a fiscal stimulus to the benefit of GDP. If or when the markets sense this spending is mismanaged it could lead to higher inflation and hurt financial assets. This is the general narrative today. In our view MMT is a risky economic experiment. It increases the size and the role of government in economic activity despite overwhelming historical evidence that governments tend to be inefficient users of capital in comparison to the private sector. Under current monetary policy the Fed simply sets the price of money and lets the animal spirits innovation and efficiencies from the private sector take over. While this system is not perfect we believe it is better than MMT as MMT is very likely to create inflation and erode asset prices in the long term. The key question becomes when In its early stages MMT could generate positive results as it looks similar to fiscal stimulus. Those gains could mask the longer term deleterious impact of higher inflation and eroding asset values. In other words MMT could fool us in the short term. Despite being based on shaky economics MMT s appealing politics have the potential to turn it into a real risk. If the U.S. or global economy falls into a recession MMT may look like a good alternative in a time of economic stress as it provides a large fiscal impulse that seemingly works significantly better than lowering interest rates. At the moment the debate over MMT in the markets will only have marginal if any impact on asset prices and inflation. In our view however its growing popularity does present a longer term risk that we will be watching closely and we will adjust our portfolio positioning accordingly. 1 Palley Thomas Modern money theory MMT the emperor still has no clothes 2014. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Given our increased weighting in health care we thought we would share how we think about the sector. In health care companies as in other sectors we are ideally looking for high sustainable returns on operating capital and predictable long term growth. Health care has grown the fastest and with the lowest drawdown in EPS over the last 20 years There is no shortage of health care companies generating high returns on capital. Given the generally nondiscretionary nature of the products on top of structural growth drivers such as ageing populations and improving access to health care in emerging markets there should also be plenty of companies able to grow in a predictable manner. As the charts below show health care currently has the second highest return on operating capital employed ROOCE it has also grown the fastest and with the lowest drawdown in earnings per share EPS over the last 20 years. Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management FactSet 31 August 2019. While this is an auspicious starting point inevitably there are some complications as we discuss in greater detail below. Patents and generics Over half of the MSCI World Health Care Index consists of either pharmaceutical pharma or biotech companies where high returns are usually a result of patent protection. A company can generate significant profits on a patented drug for around 10 years but once this patent expires sales and profits are generally decimated by generic competition. Without a pipeline of products to replace these lost sales a company will struggle to grow and its returns will fade. Pharma companies may spend a good proportion of their sales revenues ensuring a productive pipeline but drug development is a lengthy process and inherently unpredictable. While some companies have more productive research and development R D engines than others it is very hard to assess whether a company that has been productive over the previous 10 years will be productive over the next 10 years. Single product companies The above issue is exaggerated when a company is reliant on a small number of drugs a problem affecting a large number of pharma companies particularly high growth biotechs. Unexpected competition or safety issues can have a devastating impact on individual drugs. Without suitable diversification the impact can be disastrous. Government intervention Drug prices are a hugely controversial topic most notably in the U.S. For years politicians have tried to find a way to bring prices down to levels seen elsewhere in the world with very limited success. We are of the view that without moving to a prohibitively expensive single payer system it is difficult to achieve anything dramatic. Nonetheless selling drugs in the U.S. is not getting any easier. We anticipate that a combination of government and private market initiatives will ensure that this continues. Pricing pressure Outside pharma the patent pipeline risk is significantly diminished but other issues exist. Single product companies can still be at risk. Most notably pricing pressure is often rife. The trouble with pricing pressure is you have to run to stand still. Small changes in price or volume can quickly reduce an acceptable level of organic growth to stall speed impairing the potential for compounding. We seek companies reasonably immune from pricing pressure or at the very least where the volume price dynamics are such that we are highly confident in the long term organic growth outlook. We have a strong preference for companies selling consumables rather than potentially cyclical equipment Cyclicality Given the likelihood of predictable recurring revenue streams we have a strong preference for companies selling consumables rather than potentially cyclical capital equipment and we keep a close eye on the specific type of consumable that they sell. Some hospital procedures are far more elective than others and as a result the volume of consumables might be more prone to cyclicality. For example one might expect cosmetic surgery volumes to be more impacted by a recession than those for heart surgery. Our strategy We look to avoid as much as possible the pitfalls outlined above while benefitting from the previously mentioned prevalence of high and sustainable ROOCE and predictable growth. As is often the case we spend most of our time assessing what can threaten the sustainability of returns and the predictability of the growth. As always we insist on good management and a reasonable valuation. As one might expect the pool of companies that meet our strict investment criteria is limited but it has fortunately expanded over the last few years. Four of the health care holdings in our global portfolios have been transformed over recent years by spinoffs. In one case the spinoff was the desirable asset in the three other cases weaker businesses were spun off leaving behind three potentially wonderful companies. Even after this in one case we patiently waited for a reasonable valuation another required a change in management to transform the returns and another one finally became investable after an acquisition improved the level of diversification within one of its businesses. To avoid being too abstract below are some examples of industries where we have found great businesses Animal health selling medicines for animals has all of the virtues of selling conventional pharmaceuticals such as high returns and predictable growth. Furthermore the companies can be very well diversified. R D output is actually much more predictable than in conventional pharma but the biggest advantage is that there is very limited exposure to patent expiries and generics crucially this seems likely to remain the case. Diagnostics these businesses sell large bits of equipment to perform diagnostic tests of various kinds. The equipment costs relatively little for customers meaning there is limited scope to compete on price. The profitability comes from the consumables required for each test which are generally supplied on long term contracts and as a result is highly predictable. Given the importance of the installed base of equipment market shares also tend to be very stable. Hospital supplies selling syringes and intravenous fluids may not sound like great business but the barriers to entry are very high. The quality of the product and the reliability of supply is absolutely essential to hospitals and obtaining a reputation for this is very hard to achieve. Without a strong reputation persuading a hospital to take your product is extremely challenging. In turn this makes it nearly impossible to achieve the scale required to compete on price. Governance around product quality and business practice is critical to this sector Governance around product quality and business practice is critical to this sector. Issues such as device safety drug pricing or the pollution of water systems with antibiotics or other environmental hazards can quickly become reputational operational and regulatory challenges for health care companies. Our ESG environmental social governance integrated approach seeks to identify the key risks and opportunities that health care management should be focused on addressing. Increasingly society demands that such organisations operate with a sense of social responsibility and use their R D science and technology to address the world s health and hunger needs. A broad observation is that there is a higher concentration of high quality health care businesses in the U.S. than elsewhere in the world and that they are far more reasonably priced. While we have found great businesses outside the U.S. they are fewer in number and we generally struggle to find valuations that offer an appropriate margin of safety. Investing in pharma Given the above discussions of patents and pipelines as well our anticipation of an ever tougher environment for drug pricing in the U.S. it may be surprising to see so many well known pharmaceutical companies in some of our global portfolios. These companies do sell pharmaceuticals but they also derive a significant portion of their sales from businesses such as consumer health vaccines animal health crop science and diagnostics. One of our larger holdings generates almost 50% of its sales from a combination of consumer health and vaccines. Furthermore by having mature drug portfolios even in the pharma business it is possible to avoid the twin risks of patent expiries and U.S. pricing. For example another of our holdings sells a blood thinning drug where the patent has long since expired but was still generating over one billion euros of sales in emerging markets growing at 8.8%. There are also certain types of drugs such as those used to treat certain rare diseases where for idiosyncratic reasons sales should prove relatively resilient after the patent expires. While our strategy limits the risks typically associated with pharma companies we could not claim to avoid them entirely. Nonetheless the valuations are such that we feel more than compensated for the risks we take on. Our increased weight in health care reflects that some companies have reached our demanding standards for inclusion. That is they have the essential characteristics required to generate the high and sustainable returns on operating capital we look for and in so doing qualify as high quality compounders. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalsation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  For coworking operators superlatives are easy to come by. Coworking spaces in the U.S. accounted for 17% of all office net absorption in 2017 12% in Europe and 14% in Asia.1 WeWork the world s seventh largest startup and Manhattan s single largest office tenant currently has a valuation larger than any office REIT a chained annual growth rate of 90 % since its founding in 2010 and set out to open 1 million square feet of new space each month in 2018.2 It s no surprise that many participants in the office universe are searching for the right way to position themselves with respect to coworking whether through imitation collaboration or differentiation. For tenants the primary factors in choosing coworking space are its flexibility amenities technology community and immediate availability. At WeWork spaces in particular the common areas leather sofas coffee and beer bars neon slogans and mix of entrepreneurial and innovative tenants all offer the opportunity to mix and connect with a vibrant broader community in spaces architects have designed to function as a third place between home and work. Proprietary smart technology lets its users easily connect with each other and eventually seamlessly customize their office space to their physical specs and preferences. And flexible lease lengths unlock the ability for tenants to grow or shrink their footprints as needed over the short run providing optionality that typically isn t available in institutional real estate markets albeit while adding to the risk in a coworking operator s cash flow. For coworking operators value is created by signing leases with office landlords at a meaningful discount to the revenue earned from its members. WeWork and other coworking spaces operating margins are estimated to reach breakeven levels once locations reach 75% occupancy or for more spaceconstrained markets like London or New York where per square foot revenues are higher breakeven occupancy can be as low as 60%.3 DISPLAY 1 Rapidly Increasing Global Coworking Leasing Volume Source PMA JLL MSREI Strategy as of October 2018 For landlords having a coworking space as a tenant offering brings a collaborative creative millennial demographic to their buildings and can highlight their other floors as the first place for tenants to look once they are ready to expand into a traditional office lease. Coworking tenants can also help lease smaller spaces and layouts that may be less desirable for a traditional single tenant and harder for a landlord to fill. WeWork states that its locations can win 29% in rent premiums for landlords and additionally by increasing the utilization rate of existing office space as much as two to three times over coworking can support significant added footfall and demand for ground floor retail and other building amenities.4 DISPLAY 2 Coworking Share of Office Stock and Take Up Source JLL PMA Cushman Wakefield MSREI Strategy as of October 2018 With millennials rapidly becoming the largest generation in the labor force worldwide reshaping office space around their workstyles will in our view be a natural evolution for real estate investors. CBRE s Asia Pacific Occupier Survey 2018 identified four trends a younger workforce tight labor markets and the battle for talent better mobile technology and increased preference for agility and flexibility driving decision making among occupiers today.5 WeWork s pursuit of highly amenitized collaborative personalized flexible and centrally located office space is clearly intended to capitalize on these themes. Traditional corporate users including consumer businesses and tech titans from IBM to Spotify have also begun working with coworking operators to manage their real estate needs and workspaces more efficiently. Around a quarter of WeWork s revenue now comes from large companies like GE Facebook and Microsoft.6 For WeWork these corporate users provide longer term leases than its month tomonth business. For the users new FASB requirements to capitalize leases longer than one year on their balance sheets may spur more demand for coworking.7 Additionally technological advances enable corporate real estate design and predictive data analytics teams to offer insights on how and when tenants use space most productively and further minimize the space needed per employee to maximize per square foot productivity. For example one project for a large corporate client consolidated three floors of occupied space to two while increasing common areas programming space and amenities to promote collaborative encounters and interaction.8 DISPLAY 3 WeWork Membership by Industry Source The Economist MSREI Strategy as of September 2018 DISPLAY 4 Employees are Rising Share of Coworking Members Source Deskmag HOK MSREI Strategy as of September 2018 Therefore because coworking both expands demand by bringing new users into office space and compresses it by densifying the space per worker the effects on office demand in aggregate are expected to be mixed. An estimate by Cushman Wakefield suggests that of coworking s total net absorption 30% to 40% is accretive to office demand.9 Bringing telecommuters and freelancers out of home offices and coffee shops and into rented office space falls in this accretive category. However coworking space is also capturing and densifying a share of corporate flex demand small tenant leasing and core corporate office users in effect filling the same market demand in a smaller amount of office space. This suggests that the long term impact to office demand could range from a 3% increase to a 10% decrease depending on how much core corporate office demand shifts into higher density footprints.10 How far WeWork or other coworking operators can densify office fitouts also remains to be seen with important long term implications for office demand. While traditional rules of thumb of 225 square feet of space per worker have fallen to the 150 to 175 square foot range a typical coworking space minimizes this to approximately 55 to 100 square feet per person. The base case usage factor is 75 square feet per person. However because this average number includes expansive commons areas and flexible conference areas as well as personal seating the dedicated space per person is typically much tighter as low as 25 square feet. Trends in office design evolve over time and it is possible that workers may conclude 75 square feet per person is not enough particularly given the scarcity of talent may require landlords to expand space per worker as an incentive. DISPLAY 5 Office Using Employment and Office Demand Source BLS Moody s Analytics CoStar MSREI Strategy as of September 2018 DISPLAY 6 Attractive Margins but Negative Impact on Multiple Source Green Street Advisors MSREI Strategy as of November 2017 The higher density of coworking spaces also brings several new considerations to the forefront for office landlords. Estimated capital expenditure requirements are up to 50% higher than traditional office.11 High density buildouts put added burden on buildings physical systems increase security concerns and typically have low reusability should a landlord get the space back. There is also the potential for coworking space to compete for the same tenants and landlords must consider the credit of coworking operators. Even in a strong economic cycle the average coworking member stays 20 months while an average traditional office lease duration is 5 years and as industry giant WeWork pursues strong growth in membership its revenue per user has fallen on a year over year basis. One analysis found that 23% of coworking centers are unprofitable.12 And while it s important to consider these tradeoffs in an economic upcycle they come before considering the downside risk. Industry skeptics note that coworking revenue is generated by short term subscriptions typically month tomonth which creates downside risk from the duration mismatch with long term lease contracts. The shared workspace provider IWG originally known as Regus pursued a slightly differentiated space as a service business model ahead of its October 2000 IPO offering corporate clients global flexibility and turnkey office solutions before declaring bankruptcy during the economic downturn when its revenues dried up while rent payments were still due. Today IWG has a market capitalization of $2.9 billion with 52 million square feet leased worldwide 13 and WeWork s resiliency through a downturn has yet to be seen. Historically office using employment displays much higher economic sensitivity than does office demand given the greater stability of contractual lease terms.14 The next recession which many economic forecasters expect may occur in 2020 2021 will be a true test of the coworking model and may lead to significant consolidation among providers.15 DISPLAY 7 Office Occupiers Preferred Ways to Acquire Space Source CBRE Asia Pacific Occupier Survey 2018 as of April 2018 DISPLAY 8 Average Annual Lease Term on Signed Leases Source Company disclosures by BDN BXP CLI DEI HIW KRC OFC SLG VNO WRE Green Street Advisors as of July 2018 Recognizing the downside risk to demand WeWork s leases are often structured with a capped corporate level guarantee that burns down over time limiting its corporate liability for the rent but this doesn t provide comfort for the landlord who has WeWork as a tenant. Cap rates can reflect this uncertainty on the durability of WeWork leases widening out by around 35 65 basis points for properties with 50% of net rentable area leased to coworking ventures. Therefore although the pricing model and spatial buildout of coworking can increase the revenue per available square foot and NOI by as much as 50% to 60% over a traditional office lease the inherent risk to this income increases as well. Ascribing a higher capitalization rate or lower earnings multiple to the higher income to reflect this increased risk as per a Green Street Advisors analysis has so far been relatively neutral to property value.16 DISPLAY 9 Select Capital Expenditures as % of NOI Source Green Street Advisors NCREIF MSREI Strategy calculations data through September 30 2018 Even so structural forces including technology urbanization and the sheer size of the millennial generation along with regulatory changes and the corporate objectives to attract talent increase productivity and minimize costs will continue to drive demand for more amenitized office space with concierge type services and flexible lease structures. Anecdotal data from large corporate tenants who are in the market for space demonstrates that all else equal some are requesting to locate in buildings with third party coworking fitouts considering the inbuilding access to coworking seats an attractive way to address their long term need for flexibility. Accordingly many landlords brokerages and other property management entities are beginning to offer coworking buildouts themselves. For landlords with higher structural vacancy in their buildings whether older space smaller floorplates or unusual layouts adding a coworking space and potentially partnering with an operator in a revenuebased rent structure may be a natural way to raise property income and increase tenant engagement. For core office property typically with lower structural vacancy to fill and long term high credit leases in place Morgan Stanley Real Assets anticipates there may be a long term need to design and offer office space with elevated service levels and higher touch amenities. Pairing concierge hospitality level service with better fitness centers conference facilities lobbies personal care providers restaurants and top health and wellness fit outs including superior air and water purification will enhance the property experience and should support optimized rents and translate to better tenant retention through the economic cycle. Rising capital expenditures particularly tenant improvements as a share of NOI reflect this increased focus on providing top tier amenities so far with new lease terms signed remaining above the historical average. Concierge property managers whether the well known coworking operators or new entrants with modern agile facilities management capabilities could increasingly support higher tenant satisfaction better productivity in existing office space and optimized demand. Regardless of whether you believe WeWork or any other coworking ventures will ultimately succeed or fail the coworking trend in and of itself is forcing landlords to rethink the design of their traditional office space to better cater to the needs of the technology driven millennial labor force. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  After a few months of equity market enthusiasm driven by expectations of still decent global gross domestic product GDP growth perennially low interest rates and at the time of writing potential resolution of trade tensions we thought it worthwhile to provide an update on one of the major global tail risks we see Chinese corporate debt. Within the private sector in China total credit rose from 115% of GDP to 207% of GDP between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2017 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.1 As the International Monetary Fund wrote in its working paper in January 2018 International experience suggests that such rapid growth is not sustainable and is typically associated with a financial crisis and or sharp growth slowdown 2 a view we share. The Chinese government seems aware of these risks and began to slow credit growth starting in the first quarter of 2017. The debt to GDP ratio has subsequently declined moderately. In particular the component of credit supply commonly called the shadow banking system declined from an annual supply of 5 10% of GDP to effectively zero or negative by the middle of 2018. 3 Given the dependence of the Chinese economy on debt supply this led to a slowdown in GDP expansion. However in the last few months it appears as though the Chinese government has reversed course to shore up flagging GDP growth. While shadow banking remains subdued the official banking system has stepped in to offer support by amongst other things cutting reserve requirements. This lending effort is directed at privately owned small and medium sized enterprises SME a sector previously dependent upon the shadow banking system. This return to credit growth brings back concerns about a major financial crisis in China as non performing loans have also been building up. In particular the fact that banks who had previously not been lending to SMEs are now pushing hard into this higher risk sector is not very reassuring. We do not have any ability to predict how far the Chinese government is going to push credit growth as a means of maintaining high GDP growth nor whether there will be a return to rapid debt to GDP expansion. We nevertheless notice that there are developments that indicate the government is aiming to make the financial system more robust. On one level supervision has substantially tightened. In 2017 and 2018 the China Banking Regulator Commission CBRC issued fines at a run rate of approximately 1.5 billion renminbi RMB a huge step up from the approximately 100 million RMB run rate issued up until 2016. That tougher approach has resulted in banks gradually unwinding some of the more egregious accounting schemes. For instance banks used to regularly classify loans as investments by putting a rather flimsy wrapper around the issuance a practice initially meant as regulatory arbitrage to circumvent loan to deposit limits and capital requirements. More recently these structures were used to reduce the amount of reported non performing loans a practice the CBRC is now clamping down on.4 Equally regulation that allowed loans over 90 days overdue to remain as performing assets is being abolished. These as well as other measures should improve the quality of bank balance sheets in China in particular amongst the smaller more vulnerable banks. How fast and how successful this will be depends also on the recovery of the distressed debt market and capacity expansion amongst asset management companies the Chinese variant of the bad banks . Hence we see some positive trends to reduce the tail risk of a financial crisis in China. That being said the levels of debt are still extraordinarily high and the pressure to achieve strong GDP growth going forward may still trump the need to achieve medium term deleveraging. In part this will also be impacted by the U.S. China trade negotiations where a potential failure to agree on a new relationship would trigger more stimulus that supports GDP in the short term but pushes up risks in the long term. In the case of a new financial crisis we believe high quality health care and consumer staples companies would be more resilient Our portfolio has an overweight to emerging markets on a revenue basis. The companies we invest in generate an estimated 31% of their revenues in emerging markets versus 22% for the market as a whole. Revenues from China directly account for around 6% 6.0 6.7% of our global portfolios.5 This exposure is concentrated in consumer staples and health care. We believe these sectors have less exposure to either risk. In case of a slowdown of GDP growth in China these sectors tend to see far less earnings erosion than the overall market as they enjoy recurring revenues and pricing power. In the case of a new financial crisis we believe these sectors would be more resilient given the lower leverage. We would suggest that the portfolio offers a good way to gain exposure to the long term growth prospects of emerging markets in general and China in particular while remaining focused on capital preservation.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  By painting climate change with a broad brush institutional investors are overlooking opportunities to potentially generate compelling market returns and make a meaningful impact on the most pressing issue facing our planet today. Investors have come to terms with the reality that climate change is no longer a theoretical threat. The effects of extreme weather rising sea levels resource scarcity and pollution are rippling across every continent with dire consequences for individuals governments and businesses. Yet for many investors climate investing is still an abstract concept that is often lumped in with discussions of risk management consumer preferences the conflation of Environmental Social and Governance ESG with impact investing. In fact the implications of climate change are nuanced and so are the potential solutions. By looking at the issue of climate change through a broader lens we believe investors can be better positioned to identify opportunities that meaningfully address a range of climate issues and potentially deliver compelling risk adjusted returns. Here are six of the most common myths percolating around climate investing. Myth 1 The climate problem is all about global warming. REALITY Problems are manifold. For many people the term global warming evokes images of melting icebergs in the Arctic Circle. This is indeed a major and daunting consequence of climate change. Still there are many aspects of the climate issue that are more tangible and potentially more manageable. They include but are not limited to POLLUTION From visible air quality issues in smog choked Beijing and Delhi to leafy London where nitrogen oxide levels routinely exceed safe norms pollution is present in our daily lives. RESOURCE SCARCITY Drought is a growing problem that affects communities and farmers around the world. Last year Cape Town nearly ran out of water and introduced the concept of Day Zero which effectively triggers the start of drastic water rationing. California also is dealing with the acute effects of drought and now flooding. Lakes in many parts of Africa are shrinking thus leading to social strife conflict migration and refugee crises. WASTE MANAGEMENT Many of our cities are running out of landfill and other solutions to dispose waste. Plastics are making their way into the oceans marine life and our food chain at alarming levels. At the current pace there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050.1 ECO DIVERSITY Sections of pristine rainforest in Indonesia are routinely razed for agriculture and timber. This is also true in Brazil where the Amazonian rain forests produce 20% of our planet s oxygen. In 2016 alone 30% of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef was destroyed.2 Myth 2 An ESG strategy addresses climate solutions. REALITY ESG is necessary but not a sufficient condition for addressing climate change. ESG or the incorporation of environmental social and governance risk factors is an increasingly core part of any investment strategy. It seeks to limit the operational financial or reputational risk that could arise from something going wrong in one of these dimensions. We believe that creating positive climate impact however requires more than ESG hygiene. It requires actively investing in businesses typically putting primary capital to work in a private equity context whose core activities create new positive effects on the environment be it a reduction in CO2 emission pollution or resource consumption. Myth 3 Renewable energy is the main solution. REALITY The investable opportunity set goes far beyond power generation. Renewables have historically been a cornerstone of climate change investing but there is a world of opportunity besides windmills and solar panels. A comprehensive climate strategy will look beyond power generation to energy efficiency housing transportation food and recycling. Here again some of the most distinctive investment ideas both from the perspective of returns and impact focus on solving specific problems improving existing technology or making broader adoption more feasible. Minimizing the carbon impact of transportation for instance isn t just about funding electric cars and makers of lithium ion batteries. There are myriad companies in this space that are contributing to more eco friendly transportation in seemingly small but immensely impactful ways. One example is a battery exchange kiosk company in Asia which makes electric two wheelers a more viable alternative with a creative answer to charging. Rather than plugging in their vehicles and waiting for them to charge drivers use the kiosks to swap batteries. The kiosks are technology agnostic as new batteries come onto the market the company simply adds them to its catalog. Similarly green chemistry is a category that doesn t get the same attention as alternative energy but offers ample room for reducing the use of fossil fuel derivatives in items of everyday consumption from packaging materials to paints and furniture polish. The same is true of new business models around recycling compostable packaging materials waste to energy generation and waste water processing. There is also a plethora of investment ideas related to food. Demand for meat protein is growing along with the world s population and income levels. Yet livestock is a major source of emission of the greenhouse gas methane which is approximately 30 times worse than CO2.3 As such sustainable seafood which has a much smaller carbon footprint presents a blue ocean of opportunity. Myth 4 Renewables need subsidies to offer compelling returns. REALITY Cost has declined massively since the advent of renewables and pricing is now competitive with traditional energy in many markets. It was once the case that renewables thrived and died on subsidies but three major changes make this idea an antiquated one. First costs have come down substantially while technology has improved it is now feasible to deploy renewable energy in very small spaces or across remote geographies. Blades on windmills now approach aeroplane wings in terms of size and sophistication while solar panel prices have declined by more than 60% in the last decade.4 As this technology reaches critical mass installation and servicing are also becoming more cost effective and convenient. Secondly investors can now target specific projects thus making sure the solution aligns with the problem. Markets are not monoliths and energy prices along with solar and wind resources vary within regions. This makes renewables very competitive in some places and less so in others. It also puts the onus on investors to look at the specific context in which renewable projects operate. Finally demand for distributed solutions is on the rise driven by ageing grid infrastructure in developed markets and in the case of many emerging markets because of the absence of grids. A company that focuses on making and selling solar powered home systems in Southern Africa for example is opening doors for environmental and social change. In switching out kerosene or diesel for solar power consumers are saving money helping improve air quality in their communities and tapping into a more reliable and sustainable source of power. Myth 5 Early stage clean tech investing is a wild goose chase. REALITY Savvy investors target low key solutions rather than moon shots. Clean tech investing has been through a few bubble bust cycles and like other areas in early stage investing there have been some high profile successes and failures. While a lot of early attention in clean tech investing has been on grand over arching solutions there is a growing and rich universe of companies working behind the scenes to tackle specific causes or effects of climate change. Indeed the sector has evolved as have investors. Instead of looking for a silver bullet for desalination at scale savvy investors are looking at software that regulates water systems pumps. Rather than banking on the next big thing in electric cars or batteries smart early stage investors are backing things like hardware to facilitate data collection and power optimization at charging stations. These ideas may not make headlines and that is often a good thing but they are collectively creating the fabric for meaningful and incremental gains in their respective areas. Myth 6 Climate investing is highly dependent on political and regulatory changes. REALITY Individuals businesses and local governments can wield as much power. Media reports focus a lot of government level pronouncements on climate policy however the underlying trend of climate investing is a steadfast one that increasingly transcends politics. Collectively individuals corporations and local governments can wield more power. Consider the United States. While the federal government has taken a different direction on climate initiatives individual states and cities are rolling out ambitious plans of their own. In March New Mexico joined California Hawaii and the District of Columbia in setting a goal for all renewable and carbon free electricity by 2045 and governors for a dozen other U.S. states are reportedly planning to unveil similar goals. Meanwhile some of the world s largest companies are taking meaningful steps to reduce their environmental footprints. Not to be underestimated individuals are taking a stand as citizens and as consumers. This is all to say that a comprehensive climate strategy encompasses ideas big and small. It looks to address the broader threat of global warming as well as to support grassroots initiatives to seek to solve problems related to pollution resource scarcity waste management and eco diversity. Innovation does involve technology and business risk. However a globally diversified active approach across asset classes from early stage to infrastructure to agriculture can offer investors a means by which to achieve meaningful returns and make a real impact in addressing the most pressing issue facing our planet today. \n",

arise from something go wrong in one of these dimension . believe that create positive climate impact however require more than esg hygiene . require actively invest in business typically put primary capital to work in a private equity context whose core activity create new positive effect on the environment be a reduction in co2 emission pollution or resource consumption . myth 3 renewable energy be the main solution . reality the investable opportunity set go far beyond power generation . renewable have historically be a cornerstone of climate change investing but there be a world of opportunity besides windmill and solar panel . a comprehensive climate strategy will look beyond power generation to energy efficiency housing transportation food and recycling . here again some of the most distinctive investment idea both from the perspective of return and impact focus on solve specific problem improve exist technology or make broad adoption more feasible . minimize the carbon impact of transportation for instance isn t just about fund electric car and maker of lithium ion battery . there be myriad company in this space that be contribute to more eco friendly transportation in seemingly small but immensely impactful way . one example be a battery exchange kiosk company in asia which make electric two wheeler a more viable alternative with a creative answer to charge . rather than plug in vehicle and wait for to charge driver use the kiosk to swap battery . the kiosk be technology agnostic as new battery come onto the market the company simply add to catalog . similarly green chemistry be a category that doesn t get the same attention as alternative energy but offer ample room for reduce the use of fossil fuel derivative in item of everyday consumption from package material to paint and furniture polish . the same be true of new business model around recycle compostable packaging material waste to energy generation and waste water processing . there be also a plethora of investment idea relate to food . demand for meat protein be grow along with the world s population and income level . yet livestock be a major source of emission of the greenhouse gas methane which be approximately 30 time bad than co2.3 as such sustainable seafood which have a much small carbon footprint present a blue ocean of opportunity . myth 4 renewables need subsidy to offer compelling return . reality cost have decline massively since the advent of renewable and pricing be now competitive with traditional energy in many market . be once the case that renewable thrive and die on subsidy but three major change make this idea an antiquated one . first cost have come down substantially while technology have improve be now feasible to deploy renewable energy in very small space or across remote geography . blade on windmill now approach aeroplane wing in term of size and sophistication while solar panel price have decline by more than 60 % in the last decade.4 as this technology reach critical mass installation and servicing be also become more cost effective and convenient . secondly investor can now target specific project thus make sure the solution align with the problem . market be not monolith and energy price along with solar and wind resource vary within region . this make renewable very competitive in some place and less so in other . also put the onus on investor to look at the specific context in which renewable project operate . finally demand for distribute solution be on the rise drive by age grid infrastructure in develop market and in the case of many emerge market because of the absence of grid . a company that focus on make and sell solar powered home system in southern africa for example be open door for environmental and social change . in switch out kerosene or diesel for solar power consumer be save money help improve air quality in community and tap into a more reliable and sustainable source of power . myth 5 early stage clean tech investing be a wild goose chase . reality savvy investor target low key solution rather than moon shot . clean tech investing have be through a few bubble bust cycle and like other area in early stage invest there have be some high profile success and failure . while a lot of early attention in clean tech investing have be on grand over arch solution there be a grow and rich universe of company work behind the scene to tackle specific cause or effect of climate change . indeed the sector have evolve as have investor . instead of look for a silver bullet for desalination at scale savvy investor be look at software that regulate water system pump . rather than bank on the next big thing in electric car or battery smart early stage investor be back thing like hardware to facilitate datum collection and power optimization at charge station . these idea may not make headline and that be often a good thing but be collectively create the fabric for meaningful and incremental gain in respective area . myth 6 climate investing be highly dependent on political and regulatory change . reality individual business and local government can wield as much power . medium report focus a lot of government level pronouncement on climate policy however the underlie trend of climate investing be a steadfast one that increasingly transcend politic . collectively individual corporation and local government can wield more power . consider the united states . while the federal government have take a different direction on climate initiative individual state and city be roll out ambitious plan of own . in march new mexico join california hawaii and the district of columbia in set a goal for all renewable and carbon free electricity by 2045 and governor for a dozen other u.s. state be reportedly plan to unveil similar goal . meanwhile some of the world s large company be take meaningful step to reduce environmental footprint . not to be underestimate individual be take a stand as citizen and as consumer . this be all to say that a comprehensive climate strategy encompass idea big and small . look to address the broad threat of global warming as well as to support grassroots initiative to seek to solve problem relate to pollution resource scarcity waste management and eco diversity . innovation do involve technology and business risk . however a globally diversify active approach across asset class from early stage to infrastructure to agriculture can offer investor a means by which to achieve meaningful return and make a real impact in address the most pressing issue face planet today .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  After a challenging year for risky assets in emerging markets EM fixed income in particular we hold a constructive outlook for 2019 driven by attractive valuations a benign global backdrop of moderate growth subdued inflation and a U.S. Federal Reserve Bank Fed that is likely approaching the end of its tightening cycle. We believe these factors and growing twin deficits in the U.S. limit the scope for material U.S. dollar appreciation further supporting EM fixed income assets. Local currency strategies should benefit from already adequately tight monetary policy in key EM economies and steep yield curves providing investors with excess term premium. Among credit the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global EMBIG a proxy for U.S. dollar external debt screens as cheap versus both its historical average and traditional comparables such as U.S. high yield. The same holds true for the JP Morgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index CEMBI a proxy for U.S. dollar corporate debt where absolute and relative spreads have sharply underperformed other credit markets such as U.S. and European high yield in 2018 despite generally improving fundamentals that are reflected in a similarly low default profile. A stable growth moderate inflation global backdrop supports EM assets Our global outlook for 2019 is one of moderation both on the inflation and growth fronts. Continued monetary policy normalization and declining oil prices underpin our subdued global inflation outlook. We expect a similar picture of anchored and moderate inflation in EM barring some idiosyncratic cases. We also envision slowing global growth primarily in developed markets DM on the back of diminished policy support. Meanwhile EM should reinforce our moderate growth subdued inflation thesis mainly driven by weaker Chinese growth. However there is dispersion within EM several key countries are starting to recover and barring negative shocks should continue their upward march toward potential growth. We thus expect EM ex China growth to stage a mild recovery which may bode well for EM debt assets as suggested by a historical analysis of EM debt returns as seen in Display 1. Finally a context of softening U.S. growth and subdued inflationary pressures as well as unsteady U.S. stock and housing markets significantly undermines the case for further Fed hikes beyond current market pricing. Confirmation of our thesis and its corollary of potential U.S. dollar weakness next year should bode well for EM assets. Our analysis suggests an overvaluation of the USD in real terms of approximately 10 percent which strengthens our view of a weaker dollar in 2019. EM ex China at recovery stage good for EM fixed income To help inform our views on EM debt assets for the year ahead we examined the historical performance of bonds rates and stocks in EM at each stage of the business cycle which we identified as follows recovery expansion slowdown and contraction. Our output gap calculations indicate that EM ex China is currently in the recovery stage of the business cycle and to the extent that historical performance provides useful information about future return potential the analysis supports our constructive thesis for EM all EM debt strategies have posted positive returns during the recovery phase though they have failed to outperform EM equities. Display 1 EM assets have tended to outperform during the recovery stage The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management Bloomberg as of September 2018. Note Quarterly returns from March 1994 to September 2018 for U.S. dollar hard currency bonds and EM equities. For local rates EM FX and corporate bonds the sample starts March 2003 June 2003 and March 2002 respectively. We use the JP Morgan EMBIG index for U.S. dollar hard currency bonds the JP Morgan GBI EM Global Diversified index for local rates the MSCI Emerging market index for EM Equities the JP Morgan GBI EM Global Diversified FX index for EM FX and the JP Morgan Corporate EMBI Broad Diversified Composite Index for Corporates. We include the following countries to estimate the output gap Brazil Chile Colombia Czech Republic Colombia Hungary Indonesia India Mexico Malaysia Nigeria Peru Philippines Poland Romania Russia Thailand Turkey and South Africa. All metrics agree that EM sovereign spreads offer value All valuation metrics we reviewed suggest there is value in sovereign spreads EMBIG spreads look about 50 basis points cheap to their 10 year historical average and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield Index EMBIG spread differential is at all time lows despite the higher average credit rating of EM spreads. Furthermore our fair value sovereign spread model 1 which relates spreads to fundamental domestic and external variables suggests that spreads are cheap by about 40 basis points. The model also points to cheapness in Africa and to a lesser extent Latin America while flagging European sovereigns as expensive and Asian spreads as fairly priced. At the country level we like Indonesia Ukraine and South Africa conditional on a positive election outcome while we remain cautious in Turkey and Mexico. Value in local rates on high EM DM real rate gap steep curves amid U.S. dollar weakness EM real rates still look compelling at 2 percent levels and similarly the real yield differential with DM remains attractive at 300 basis points. We expect real rate differentials to remain at elevated levels next year as Fed Fund rates get closer to neutral other DM Central Banks cautiously remove monetary stimulus global inflation remains subdued and EM Central Banks keep tight monetary policy stances. In addition sizable steepness in several EM curves offer attractive opportunities for extending duration for example in Peru and Brazil while we avoid long duration positions in Mexico given heightened policy uncertainty. Valuations in EM corporate debt look favorable relative to default expectations We see the sharp correction of EM corporate spreads particularly in high yield since the turn of 2Q18 as excessive given our assessment of credit fundamentals. Our confidence in EM credit is grounded in improving metrics credit management actions etc. . The improvement has been supported by the behavior of EM corporates since the end of the global financial crisis. These improvements are best illustrated in default expectations which now look likely to end the year well below the 2.5% forecast we set at the beginning of the year in spite of the rise in idiosyncratic negative developments in countries such as Argentina and Turkey. Looking ahead to 2019 we view the spread widening of EM high yield as particularly noteworthy given expectations that default rates in EM will likely remain low and in line with U.S. high yield next year. In investment grade credit we also believe the weakness in spreads is somewhat counterintuitive given fundamental improvements in EM credit quality which should continue to see upgrades outpace downgrades over the coming 12 18 months versus in the U.S. where the combination of debt financed stock buy backs and merger and acquisition M A activity may put pressure on credit ratings in 2019. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  We believe that fintech alternative lending an asset class born of bank disintermediation and technological innovation may offer benefits to both borrowers and investors. Industry growth data appears to bear this out and we think two factors have been primarily responsible for this growth. The first is the attractive structure of alternative loans as compared to credit card debt. And the second is the way alternative lenders cater to evolving consumer banking habits which mirror evolving shopping habits consumers prefer to transact online. Alternative lending takes place through online platforms that use technology to bring together borrowers who may be underserved by traditional banking with loan investors seeking attractive yield generating investments. While the asset class originated as peer to peer lending institutional investors fund most alternative loans today.1 The alternative lending universe encompasses consumer loans small business loans and various specialty finance loans. Of these consumer unsecured loans represent the largest segment. These loans often have three to five year terms and are fully amortizing via monthly installment payments. They generally have relatively low initial balances of $5 000 $25 000 and borrowers often use them for debt consolidation or refinancing.2 BENEFITTING BORROWERS AND INVESTORS By shifting from revolving credit card debt to an amortizing unsecured installment loan a borrower may benefit from a lower interest rate and a fixed term over which the debt can be repaid. By taking on credit risk as compared to holding a similar duration Treasury security an investor may obtain a higher expected return and gain consumer credit exposure which historically has been challenging to access. RECENT GROWTH IN UNSECURED CONSUMER LOANS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND SKEWED TO FINTECH Personal loans underwritten by fintech alternative lending platforms have grown rapidly since the global financial crisis. A recent study by TransUnion found that outstanding unsecured personal loan balances rose by $21 billion in 2018 to $138 billion with much of the growth coming from loans originated by fintechs.3 Indeed fintechs accounted for roughly 38% of the outstanding balances at the end of 2018 up from just 5% only five years earlier.3 Display 1 Display 1 Historical Outstanding Personal Loan Balances and Fintech Market Share Source https www.transunion.com IIR utmsource press release utm medium press release utm campaign Q4 2018 IIR utm source press release accessed April 23 2019 and Q4 2018 Financial Services Industry Insight Report Senior Manager Kristen Bataillon Financial Services Research Consulting TransUnion 2019 A closer look at the data reveals that it s not just banks that are losing ground to fintech credit unions and traditional finance companies have been steadily ceding market share as well.

That compares to roughly $48 billion of total personal loans originated just five years ago.4 Display 3 Display 3 Unsecured Personal Loan Balances Originated Source Transunion Financial Services Seminar Smarter Decisions The Consumer First Era The 8 Minute Industry Update Vice President Matt Komos Research and Consulting page 14 and Q4 2018 Financial Services Industry Insight Report Senior Manager Kristen Bataillon Financial Services Research Consulting TransUnion. Please note that 2018 data is annualized based on 3Q2018 data. WHAT EXPLAINS THE GROWTH We think two factors have been driving fintech s ascendancy in the personal lending space 1 the attractive structure of the loans themselves for both borrowers and investors in comparison to credit cards loans and 2 the evolution in borrower behavior. THE POWER OF AMORTIZATION We believe that the amortizing installment structure typical of unsecured consumer loans originated by alternative lenders is one reason why these loans have seen such significant growth in recent years. Amortization may allow unsecured consumer loans to be extended to borrowers at interest rates below what might be charged on revolving credit card loans to comparable borrowers while still compensating lenders for the credit risk that they are taking. When extending credit to a borrower a lender must evaluate both the probability of default and the magnitude of potential loss. Unfortunately default probability becomes increasingly difficult to forecast the further forward one looks from today since the economic backdrop and a borrower s financial situation evolve over time in potentially unpredictable ways. Amortizing loans compensate for this uncertainty through outstanding balances that progressively decline over time reducing the magnitude of loss in the event of loan default. Conversely credit card lenders must be compensated for the increased potential of future losses associated with revolving balances that do not necessarily decline with time. They may thus charge higher rates as compared to amortizing loans to comparable borrowers. Display 4 compares the outstanding balance on a monthly amortizing 3 year personal loan with an interest only revolving loan over the expected life of the personal loan. The personal loan s amortizing structure has lower outstanding balances over time as the probability of default becomes less predictable. By contrast the interest only revolving balance remains elevated. Display 4 Capital at Risk Through the Life of a Loan Revolving Loan vs. Fully Amortizing Unsecured Personal Loan Source AIP Alternative Lending Group. For illustrative purposes only. EVOLVING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR We believe consumer behavior is another force behind the growth in fintech alternative lending. As can be seen by the widespread trend toward online shopping consumer behavior has evolved meaningfully in recent years. Indeed today consumer preference and comfort with transacting online extends to banking. Demographics also play a role Millennials represent the largest generation in American history5 and most prefer to bank via smartphone.6 Furthermore two thirds of people under 30 have no credit card which may translate into thinner credit files.7 A thinner credit file makes a FICO credit score the backward looking measure of creditworthiness on which banks often base lending decisions less useful. Alternative lenders may augment traditional credit metrics with unconventional data sources that indicate borrower willingness and ability to pay and they can do so in a highly automated fashion that accelerates crediting decisions. Many alternative lenders may also use artificial intelligence machine learning techniques in their underwriting when incorporating non traditional data sources. In this manner alternative lending may increase financial inclusion and access to affordable credit.8 LOOKING AHEAD While growth in unsecured personal loans has been rapid we believe that there is room for further expansion. Roughly 19 million consumers in the U.S. have a personal loan with an average balance of roughly $8 000. This is dwarfed by the roughly 179 million credit cardholders representing outstanding U.S. credit card debt of about $800 billion. Put differently credit card penetration stands at about 63% of the U.S. population whereas personal loan penetration is only about 7%.9 Display 5 Display 5 U.S. Market Penetration Rates Credit Cards vs. Personal Loans at 12 31 2018 Source Q4 2018 Financial Services Industry Insight Report Senior Manager Kristen Bataillon Financial Services Research Consulting TransUnion page 43 The next economic downturn will be an instructive stress test of the assumptions underpinning growth in fintech alternative lending. However the combination of low penetration rate and the key growth drivers previously discussed attractive loan structures for borrowers and investors alongside an increasing consumer desire to do business online suggests opportunity for continued growth in the nascent asset class of fintech alternative lending. 1 Bank for International Settlements BIS Quarterly Review Claessens Frost Turner and Zhu.

      "Doc - Orig:  Our location in Hong Kong gives us a unique perspective on the risks and opportunities of investing in China a market we believe is ripe with opportunity for bottom up stock picking particularly in the consumer internet healthcare and education industries. China offers vast opportunity to investors willing to extend their time horizon and take a long term view. Regardless of the consensus view that short term real gross domestic product GDP growth is slowing China represents nearly 1 5 of the world s population and 1 6 of the economy yet is under represented by global equity indices at just 2.3 percent of the MSCI All Country World Index. In the years ahead we expect that gap to narrow as China s economy evolves and innovative companies address China s growing demand for consumption and services thus necessitating an increase in index weightings for China. Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management FactSet United Nations Population Division IMF and MSCI. Data as of March 31 2017. China s economy is undergoing a massive transition from fixed asset investment in heavy industry and manufacturing to growth in consumption and services. The contribution to GDP from consumption has averaged 4.7 percent over the past decade and in the last five years has accelerated from 3.6 to 5.3 percent as of the first quarter of 2017. China s consumption growth provides investors with a baseline to expect from the economy going forward even without the benefit of growth in investment or exports the world s second largest consumer will likely continue to grow faster than the developed world in the years ahead based on consumption growth alone.1 Over 800 million people have emerged from poverty in China since market reforms were introduced in 1978.2 This emerging middle class wants what those in developed markets have long enjoyed and perhaps take for granted higher quality consumable products such as food and beverages internet services to share experiences with family and friends access to healthcare and better education opportunities for their children. After three decades of rapid real GDP growth driven by fixed asset investment in heavy industry China is adjusting to a more moderate pace driven by consumption and services. Rebalancing the world s second largest economy is not without its well known challenges but as bottom up investors we look through the short term macro noise and have been finding plenty of high quality stocks in China. Therefore we believe that if you want to find some of the best bottom up stock ideas of the next decade then look to China because as Charlie Munger Warren Buffett s long time partner said about China It s a happier hunting ground. 3 Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in these portfolios. Please be aware that these portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact these portfolios to a greater extent than if these portfolios assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Asia market entails liquidity risk due to the small markets and low trading volume in many countries. In addition companies in the region tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. Furthermore because the strategy concentrates in a single region of the world performance may be more volatile than a global strategy. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them liquidity risk . Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. To the extent that the Fund invests in a limited number of issuers focused investing the Fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund s overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely. 1Source CEIC.

      "Doc - Orig:  In this paper we outline some of the features of Fixed Index Annuities FIAs and share our observations regarding their performance developments in underlying index design and the important role asset managers are increasingly playing within the space. Introduction Planning for a comfortable retirement in today s environment is challenging. The shift from employer sponsored Defined Benefit plans to Defined Contribution plans has placed the burden of investing for retirement on the shoulders of individual investors. In a low return environment it is critical that individuals make sensible investment choices that enable them to achieve their savings goals. Annuities may be an attractive investment option for individuals who want to protect a portion of their retirement portfolio from a variety of risks. Whilst there are many different types of annuities from variable to fixed the focus of this paper is on developments within the FIA market. FIAs are tax favored accumulation products generally issued by insurance companies. With an index annuity growth is benchmarked to an index rather than an interest rate. Indexes used in FIAs range from well known market benchmarks such as the S P 500 to custom multi asset indexes designed by financial companies such as banks and asset managers. An FIA s growth is subject to floors and caps meaning it will not exceed or fall below specified return levels even if the underlying index fluctuates outside of those set parameters. In simplest terms the insurance company bears the risk when an FIA s benchmark index declines. Investors will not lose their principal but there is often a ceiling on their potential gains. We will focus briefly on the potential benefits and risks of investing in these vehicles and the importance of selecting an annuity with an appropriate index. The Impact of Index Selection on Fixed Income Annuities A key benefit of FIAs is that they shift downside investment risk from the purchaser to the provider. Another attractive feature of annuities is that they often provide lifetime income for an additional fee. The certainty of income that an annuity provides may discourage investors from making poor decisions during periods of short term volatility such as panic selling or attempting to time the market s ups and downs. As with any investment it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of investing in annuities. Investors may incur penalties for early withdrawals therefore they must be financially capable of bearing a certain level of illiquidity and be appropriately compensated for doing so. In addition annuity fees may be significant and investors in capped FIAs often forego upside gains beyond a pre specified level. A central issue to consider when selecting an FIA is the nature of the underlying index. If the annuity provider assumes the downside investment risk and guarantees both the principal and the future level of income why does this matter The answer is that the likelihood that the index will meet certain performance and volatility targets factors into the overall pricing of the annuity and the ability of the provider to offer investors other attractive product features. Insurance companies are willing to assume the downside market exposure stemming from the annuity because they employ various hedging strategies to mitigate much of this risk. The costs of these strategies are factored into the overall level of fees charged to the annuity holder. The less expensive it is to hedge the index the lower the level of fees that the annuity provider may potentially charge the investor. Factors that impact the cost of the hedge include the volatility of the index its complexity transaction costs and ease of trading. It is important to note that lowering the cost of the hedge is not in and of itself enough to provide quality returns to an investor. An attractive annuity is able to find a balance between the cost of the hedging strategy and the return potential of the index. Asset Managers are Driving Improvement in Fixed Index Annuity Design Recently there have been significant improvements in index design coinciding with increased involvement by asset management firms with expertise in portfolio construction dynamic management investment selection and long term wealth accumulation. Modern portfolio theory considerations surrounding investment efficiency and diversification are now becoming more prevalent in the index design process. Evolved index designs allow annuity providers to make use of diversified multi asset class indexes in their products rather than single asset class indexes e.g. standalone equity or fixed income indexes . Key benefits of diversification are the potential to lower volatility and to contribute to a higher level of index return. Annuities tend to be structured with terms that vary from 5 to 12 or more years. As such investors and insurance carriers must be comfortable with the asset classes that they will be exposed to at the beginning of the annuity term and the process in place to manage the annuity when the market environment changes. For example if an index is based on a single market segment such as U.S. large cap equities and that segment of the market crashes the owner of the annuity is cushioned from the fall but may not benefit from short term market rebounds. Fortunately insurance carriers have been mindful of these challenges and have started to work with asset managers to help address these issues. Beyond the natural risk mitigation of diversification index providers have developed solutions that are more mindful of investment risks in areas such as asset allocation. Recent improvements include the addition of risk metrics beyond volatility into index construction e.g. duration risk dynamic risk controls such as increasing allocations to cash in response to spikes in volatility accounting for cross asset class correlations and incorporating market factors such as momentum and valuation. Conclusion Annuities in general and FIAs in particular may provide a sensible tax deferred investment option for individuals saving for retirement. Adding annuities to a diversified portfolio may enhance the level of income that is available to investors during their retirement. Fortunately for both annuity purchasers and providers FIA design continues to advance and in our view should continue to result in better investment management solutions for clients. Investors should question their insurance providers not only about the features of the annuity but also about the benefits and drawbacks of the underlying index as well. \n",
      "Doc - Lemmatized:   in this paper outline some of the feature of fixed index annuities fia and share observation regard performance development in underlie index design and the important role asset manager be increasingly play within the space . introduction planning for a comfortable retirement in today s environment be challenge . the shift from employer sponsor defined benefit plan to define contribution plan have place the burden of invest for retirement on the shoulder of individual investor . in a low return environment be critical that individual make sensible investment choice that enable to achieve saving goal . annuity may be an attractive investment option for individual who want to protect a portion of retirement portfolio from a variety of risk . whilst there be many different type of annuity from variable to fix the focus of this paper be on development within the fia market . fia be tax favor accumulation product generally issue by insurance company . with an index annuity growth be benchmarke to an index rather than an interest rate . index use in fia range from well know market benchmark such as the s p 500 to custom multi asset index design by financial company such as bank and asset manager . an fia s growth be subject to floor and cap mean will not exceed or fall below specify return level even if the underlying index fluctuate outside of those set parameter . in simple term the insurance company bear the risk when an fia s benchmark index decline . investor will not lose principal but there be often a ceiling on potential gain . will focus briefly on the potential benefit and risk of invest in these vehicle and the importance of select an annuity with an appropriate index . the impact of index selection on fixed income annuities a key benefit of fia be that shift downside investment risk from the purchaser to the provider . another attractive feature of annuity be that often provide lifetime income for an additional fee . the certainty of income that an annuity provide may discourage investor from make poor decision during period of short term volatility such as panic selling or attempt to time the market s up and down . as with any investment be important to be aware of the potential drawback of invest in annuity . investor may incur penalty for early withdrawal therefore must be financially capable of bear a certain level of illiquidity and be appropriately compensate for do so . in addition annuity fee may be significant and investor in capped fia often forego upside gain beyond a pre specify level . a central issue to consider when select an fia be the nature of the underlie index . if the annuity provider assume the downside investment risk and guarantee both the principal and the future level of income why do this matter the answer be that the likelihood that the index will meet certain performance and volatility target factor into the overall pricing of the annuity and the ability of the provider to offer investor other attractive product feature . insurance company be willing to assume the downside market exposure stem from the annuity because employ various hedging strategy to mitigate much of this risk . the cost of these strategy be factor into the overall level of fee charge to the annuity holder . the less expensive be to hedge the index the low the level of fee that the annuity provider may potentially charge the investor . factor that impact the cost of the hedge include the volatility of the index complexity transaction cost and ease of trading . be important to note that lower the cost of the hedge be not in and of enough to provide quality return to an investor . an attractive annuity be able to find a balance between the cost of the hedging strategy and the return potential of the index . asset managers be drive improvement in fixed index annuity design recently there have be significant improvement in index design coincide with increase involvement by asset management firm with expertise in portfolio construction dynamic management investment selection and long term wealth accumulation . modern portfolio theory consideration surround investment efficiency and diversification be now become more prevalent in the index design process . evolved index design allow annuity provider to make use of diversified multi asset class index in product rather than single asset class index e.g. standalone equity or fix income index . key benefit of diversification be the potential to lower volatility and to contribute to a high level of index return

      "Doc - Orig:  The global macroenvironment begins 2019 having achieved forecasted Gross Domestic Product GDP growth of 3.8% the strongest year of growth in this cycle.1 However despite strong underlying global fundamentals including two quarters of abovetrend growth in the U.S. 4.2% in the second quarter and 3.5% in the third quarter 2 the year has ended amid significantly higher capital markets volatility triggered by continued uncertainties over trade Brexit other geopolitical tensions and Central Bank actions. This increased volatility has yet to create any broad based weakness in real estate markets with underlying fundamentals remaining strong underpinned by the strong global macro backdrop and secular trends including ecommerce and urbanization. Real estate capital markets have also remained relatively immune to this recent market turbulence with pricing levels remaining at or above historical highs due to the abundance of capital targeting the sector allocations increased to 10.4% in the U.S. up 30bps over 2017 3 and interest rates at near historic lows in most markets. In 2019 Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing MSREI believes economic growth will moderate globally and diverge across major markets while interest rate policies are expected to converge and financial conditions will likely tighten. The combination of lower macroeconomic growth and higher interest rates will likely lead to lower commercial real estate returns broadly as a result of moderating real estate fundamentals and flat to marginally higher cap rates. However returns will likely be more differentiated by market and sector requiring investment managers to be more discerning in defining optimal investment strategies and deploying capital against those strategies. Global Macroeconomic Environment The global growth cycle is expected to moderate in 2019 with forecasted GDP growth of 3.6% from 3.8% in 2018 which remains above the historical average of 3.5%.4 The moderation will be driven by a slowdown in developed markets predominantly in the U.S. as tighter resources and less supportive policy become more significant headwinds. We expect continued moderation in growth through 2020 with heightened recession risk in the U.S. due to tighter financial conditions and less fiscal support. In most developed markets we expect that tighter labor markets will lift wage growth bringing inflation levels higher and near cycle peaks. Given recent US Federal Reserve System Fed rhetoric we expect a pause in the U.S. interest rate hiking cycle in the third quarter of 2019 while the European Central Bank ECB is expected to embark on the next stage of policy normalization and begin their gradual rate hiking cycle. Emerging markets are expected to retake the lead in driving global growth helped by the expected pause by the Fed a weaker USD and softer oil prices. Key global risks worth noting include corporate credit defaults in the U.S. nonfinancial corporate leverage is now 73% of GDP up from 64% in 2012 5 with the rise driven more by highly levered companies trade and technology Intellectual Property tensions with China which are expected to continue despite recent positive news around the tariff pause reduction in tariffs on U.S. autos and reemergence of China buying U.S. agriculture products and other idiosyncratic risks including Brexit Italy s and France s fiscal situation and political uncertainty in Germany. DISPLAY 1 GDP Growth Source IMF World Economic Outlook October 2018 Morgan Stanley Research data as of December 2018 United States GDP growth is expected to accelerate in the first half of 2019 as a result of a record high tax refund season propelling consumer spending.6 However by midto late 2019 growth is expected to slow below trend as fiscal stimulus fades GDP impact dropping from 0.8pp in 2018 to 0.2pp in 2019 7 and tighter financial conditions from earlier interest rate hikes take hold. As real interest rates are likely to reach neutral in the middle of 2019 it is expected that the Fed pauses with future rate changes dependent on incoming data. Further moderation in growth is expected into 2020 with a chance that the economy flatlines or enters negative territory at some point during that year. From a capital markets perspective this heightened volatility seen over the past several months is likely to continue into the first quarter of this year. Ten year bond yields have dropped 39bps from their high of 3.24% in early November 2018 back to 2.85% in early December leading to a widening of cap rate spreads from 155bps to 194bps while the equity markets have corrected by 12% since October.8 Treasury yields are expected to creep back up next year supported by growth inflation Fed tightening and a widening budget deficit. While this volatility is reportedly leading to thinner bidder pools it has not yet led to any broad based negative pricing impacts with the Moody s Commercial Property Price Index up 7% through the end of November on a year over year basis.9 On the margin lower quality non core properties in secondary tertiary markets are likely to be more impacted as capital becomes more selective and focused on defensive asset types and liquid markets. Overall in the absence of a more pronounced equity market correction that could lead to capital outflows from portfolio rebalancing we would anticipate that investors will continue to allocate similar levels of capital to the real estate sector eyeing its long term stability attractive income component and strong absolute and relative returns. Property fundamentals in the U.S. will likely remain relatively strong buoyed by above average economic activity this year and through the first half of next year. Vacancy rates will likely remain below their long term averages in all sectors supporting continued rent growth in the absence of significant new supply which has been constrained by rapidly rising construction costs and lending restrictions. Industrial property continues to perform very well vacancy is currently at record lows below 5% and Net Operating Income NOI growth is expected to do better than the other sectors 4.5% over the next five years versus 2.2% on average for the other sectors supported by e commerce tailwinds growing at 15% p.a. continued strong global growth and higher manufacturing output.10 Supply is increasing but is being absorbed. DISPLAY 2 Cap Rates Source NCREIF Bloomberg MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018 DISPLAY 3 Performance by Property Type Source NCREIF MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018 Users and capital are flowing away from primary distribution hubs to secondary markets to be close to population centers and deeper labor pools. Conversely retail continues to be the most challenged sector but remains very bifurcated Class A malls sales per square foot are trading at a 10% premium compared to 2007 peak levels while Class B C productivity is down 50%.13 Recent trades and recaps suggest pricing of 4.25 4.5% for Class A malls 14 indicating no apparent weakness for the best quality centers while there continues to be zero few bids for Class B C product. High street locations have also experienced more weakness across the entire quality spectrum due to lower sales productivity higher occupancy costs and the proliferation of tenant location options. Similar to malls the better quality high street locations are experiencing less rental decline than secondary tertiary locations. The office sector is expected to maintain moderate NOI growth helped by low levels of supply this cycle continued strong job growth and a bottoming reversal of the densification trends seen over the past five years as firms try to attract and retain top talent. In the apartment sector while headwinds from high supply growth continue to act as a drag on fundamentals demand for rentals continues to be strong given the lack of affordability in the for sale market a continued urbanization trend and lifestyle preferences of the millennial cohort. The healthcare sector is becoming increasingly attractive due to cashflow stability particularly in medical office and above average healthcare job growth 2x that of other sectors supported by aging demographics. Finally hospitality has re emerged as an attractive investment alternative given wider yields 300bps spread over traditional sectors 15 strong corporate profits up 7.3% YOY and increased foreign travel spending up 3.3% YOY .16 Europe In Europe growth is expected to remain relatively stable and moderate towards trend while inflation is expected to rise as labor markets tighten capacity constraints build and exports slow. Growth will likely continue to be strongest in Central and Eastern Europe CEE countries Spain and the Nordics. The expansion looks sustainable due to the underlying strength of domestic demand with neither the existence of overheating requiring a sharp policy tightening nor evidence of major imbalances outside of ongoing wage productivity divergence between Northern and Southern European countries. Productivity looks set to rise but should remain structurally below precrisis levels. The European Central Bank announced the end of the quantitative easing era on December 13 2018 however interest rates are not expected to increase until the fourth quarter of 2019.17 In the absence of further monetary policy support countries may revert to fiscal measures to stimulate demand evidenced in recent budget proposals from Italy and France largely in response to recent protests . Proposed structural reforms and spending if approved will likely increase budget deficits above the European Stability Mechanism limit of 3% of GDP which may create more tensions within the European Union. Given Europe s reliance on exports rising trade tensions remain the key downside risk in part offset by a weaker currency in the short term and a potentially bigger fiscal impulse in the long term. In the UK following the decision to postpone the meaningful parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal pending an attempt to gain further assurances on the backstop for Northern Ireland the Brexit timeline and outcome remains uncertain. Prime Minister May s victory in the confidence vote on her leadership on December 12 2018 has potentially reduced the risk of a no deal outcome and improved the prospects for her deal or a slightly modified version passing. While the parliamentary majority opposed to a no deal outcome implies a soft spectrum of Brexit outcomes at the moment the outcome remains open and a no deal no transition Brexit or even a second referendum remain as possibilities if nothing else is agreed. Assuming a soft Brexit outcome growth is expected to slow sharply in the near term due to heightened uncertainty but under this scenario growth is likely to recover in the back half of 2019 due to a rebound in investment and business confidence. From a capital markets perspective real estate markets across Europe are enjoying a sustained period of above average returns.18 Additionally despite low overall cap rates the continued low interest rate environment has resulted in attractive cap rate spreads versus other major markets which has helped compensate investors for geopolitical strains and potential trade headwinds. Even if interest rates rise in late 2019 and 2020 as expected the impact on yields will likely be minimal due to the wide cushion that exists between investment grade real estate and government bonds. While returns are expected to moderate with slower growth and marginally higher interest rates significant differences between the performance of different cities and sectors will continue creating opportunities to outperform the broad market. DISPLAY 4 Cap Rate Spread Source Bloomberg PMA NCREIF MSREI Strategy data as of November 2018 Additionally uncertainties surrounding Brexit and other idiosyncratic challenges Italy France Germany Spain may create pockets of illiquidity and mispricing an example of which exists today in the City of London where the difference in yields between a long term leased office building and a similarly welllocated asset with some leasing risk has expanded to 200 300bps.19 Real estate fundamentals currently remain healthy across all sectors. In the office sector the vacancy rate is now 200bps below the historical average20 and rents are rising driven by the combination of low supply and accelerating absorption largely underpinned by increases in professional services and technology job growth. While yields at the prime end of the market have compressed to record lows there are potentially opportunities for investors to target investments in emerging higher growth and higher yielding submarkets perhaps adjacent to traditional Central Business District submarkets which are being transformed by new technology healthcare clusters or new transport links and other infrastructure. MSREI also believes that faster growth CEE countries could offer opportunities to reposition high quality office assets in prime locations taking advantage of the shift in middle and back office functions to markets like Budapest Warsaw and Bucharest which is helping to drive the rental recovery in those markets. Additionally institutional liquidity is growing and yield spreads between primary and secondary cities remain attractive in those markets. In the industrial sector on line sales growth continues to significantly outpace broad based retail sales growth contributing to strong demand for logistics while there continues to be a shortage of modern industrial stock suggesting development is required to meet modern logistics needs. While industrial rent growth has been close to zero over the past five years growth has accelerated above 2% in 2018 and is expected to remain strong over the next several years.21 Industrial yields remain higher than office and investor allocations to the sector are accelerating which is likely to lead to more yield compression. In the retail sector despite steady growth in consumer spending and a relatively under retailed environment fundamentals will be challenged due to continued growth in e commerce shifts in retailer business models and future store closures. Looking beyond the three main traditional sectors the occupier markets for European hotel and residential look to be in good shape. Supported by the improving business climate and rising international tourist arrivals the hotel market is seeing a solid increase in demand. Average occupancy has reached 73% as at November 2018 up from 67% five years earlier.22 Demand for private residential is also growing across many European markets driven by both reduced access to mortgage products and changing lifestyles. Home ownership rates across the European Union fell to around 70% in 2018 down from 73.2% in 2008.23 DISPLAY 5 Increasing Net Absorption Source PMA MSREI Strategy as of August 2018. Past performance is not indicative of future results DISPLAY 6 Supply Levels In Check Source PMA MSREI Strategy as of August 2018. Past performance is not indicative of future results Asia Pacific The Asia Pacific region has been disproportionately impacted by trade disputes this year given the more open export nature of most of their economies. While economic fundamentals have remained solid regional growth still above 4% through the third quarter trade headwinds are likely to persist in the near term leading to more growth moderation.24 Across Asia growth in Japan is expected to accelerate but fluctuate around the consumption tax hike scheduled for 2019. Private consumption is likely to be frontloaded leading to a strong first half of 2019 while productivity enhancing capex will help to offset lower expected exports supporting growth of around 1.3% in 2019 versus 0.8% in 2018 .25 China s growth is expected to slow through the first half of 2019 as the lagged effects of deleveraging and trade tensions weigh on consumption and business confidence before stabilizing amid increased policy easing to support the private sector and infrastructure. Recent positive news on trade talks including the 90 day pause as well as the Wall Street Journal reportthat China is rewriting its 2025 policy26 and considering state owned enterprises competitive neutrality suggests that more escalation in tariffs may not be required. That being said Morgan Stanley Research still believes tariffs will be increased to 25% on the $200Bn of goods already tariffed at 10%. However given progress made the remaining $267Bn of exports may not be tariffed. This outcome would lead to a pullback in GDP growth of about 0.3pp compared to 2018 levels versus 0.7pp under the previous more bearish scenario. Australia s growth will likely remain strong but is expected to ease back below trend due to a deteriorating housing market weighing on consumption and construction partially offset by increased government expenditure and a weaker AUD. Lastly in Korea growth momentum is likely to drift lower as trade growth moderates and domestic demand slows due to a pullback in job growth and uneven wage growth. Interest rates across the region are projected to remain accommodative with central banks in Australia South Korea and China expected to keep rates on hold through the end of 2019 while the Bank of Japan may move away from its negative to zero interest rate policy in 2019. As a result cap rate spreads are expected to remain relatively wide with minimal impact on yields over the next several years. Returns are expected to slow below the long term average and will be driven by income yields as capital growth is expected to be held back by flat yields. Property fundamentals across Asia Pacific are expected to remain favorable with the industrial sector likely to outperform consistent with other global regions. Online sales penetration is highest in China and Korea while modern logistics stock remains undersupplied across the whole region.28 Industrial rents continue to climb in most major markets in Asia Pacific with the fastest growth in Australia Hong Kong and China.29 Income yields are attractive relative to other sectors and the sector is becoming more institutional which will likely lead to further yield compression in several markets. Asia Pacific office markets are expected to continue to offer broad based growth over the next couple of years particularly in Melbourne Sydney and in core Japanese markets with stable corporate occupier demand outpacing limited supply. Diverging trends have developed in the retail environment across the region. Retail sales continue to underperform in some major markets in the region including Hong Kong and Singapore due to soft domestic consumption. However key cities in Australia South Korea and Japan continue to see relatively healthy rental growth supported by resilient domestic consumption tourism and low levels of competing new supply.30 However similar to other regions structural shifts in consumer shopping behavior may continue to exert pressures on retailers which will likely negatively impact all but the best performing and optimally located centers. DISPLAY 7 New Construction Below Historical Average Source CoStar PMA MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018 DISPLAY 8 Attractive Industrial Yields Source Broker Reports data as of December 2018 Conclusion Over the next couple of years global growth will be expected to move back towards trend and likely be characterized by more pockets of divergence versus the synchronicity we have seen since 2017. Uncertainty and capital markets volatility will likely remain as dominant themes due to multiple ongoing geopolitical events across the U.S. Europe and Asia. Commercial real estate may be a beneficiary of this environment given investor preference for longer term stability cash flow and diversification. However real estate returns across most markets may be lower and more variable compared with the broadbased above average levels achieved over the past five years. Additionally compelling investment opportunities may become more challenging as investors rationalize late cycle pricing with the changing growth environment. Within this investing backdrop MSREI believes the ability to understand the macro investing environment access in depth local market knowledge leverage strong partner relationships and create growth in income streams will differentiate managers in their pursuit of abovemarket returns. 1 Morgan Stanley Research November 2018. 2 Bureau of Economic Analysis November 2018. 3 Hodes Weill Associates 2018 Institutional Real Estate Allocations Monitor. 4 International Monetary Fund December 2018 Morgan Stanley Global Macro Outlook November 2018. 5 Haver Analytics Morgan Stanley Research. 6 Morgan Stanley Research Global Macro Outlook November 2018. 7 Morgan Stanley Research 2019 Global Outlook. 8 Bloomberg MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018. 9 Moody s Commercial Property Price Index RCA November 2018. 10 CoStar Census Bureau MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018. 11 Capitalization rate commonly known as cap rate is a rate that helps in evaluating a real estate investment.

      "Doc - Orig:  In Aesop s original fable the tortoise took on the hare. The hare s raw pace took it into a substantial lead but a complacent nap meant that the tortoise plodded past to victory. The investment variant of the fable is somewhat different. Once again the hare races off into an early lead and is presumably awarded an eye wateringly steep multiple by the market. Sadly the flying four legged furball is likely to come to an unfortunate end picked off by a farmer or some other predator frozen to death in a cold recession or just running around in frenzied circles. Meanwhile the tortoise just trundles along steadily perhaps pulling its head in when times get tough. Slow and steady wins the long term race in the markets as well The tortoise is not a perfect analogy for a compounder as we like to think of the companies we own as somewhat more dynamic than the sluggish shell bearing reptile. Nevertheless the secret of compounding lies in steady modest growth at sustained high returns. A company growing at say 4% a year adding another 1% to earnings growth from incrementally improving margins combined with a free cash flow yield of around 5% should compound at close to 10% over time. This would not only provide an excellent absolute return doubling one s capital every seven years but it is unlikely to be matched by lower quality companies as bad things happen to bad companies at bad times as many hares discover sooner or later. Slow and steady wins the long term race in the markets as well. The problem is that these compounders are very rare beasts and rather tougher to pick out than tortoises so here s a spotters guide. What is the essence of a compounder At the core of the compounder are powerful and hard to replicate intangible assets notably brands or networks. These help deliver pricing power. Compounders have decent growth prospects together with predictable sales often driven by recurring revenues. Crucially management must be shareholder friendly. Being careful stewards of capital and investing sufficiently in innovation and advertising to help perpetuate the franchises are essential management hallmarks. Where is the compounder found It is easier to describe where the compounder will not be found banks utilities telecoms even if rebranded as communication services miners and energy companies are all low return cyclical price takers and thus unable to compound. The two richest hunting grounds for compounders are consumer staples and the software and IT services sub sector of information technology effectively the brands consumers choose the software and services businesses need and the networks people trust. Our commentaries from May and June 2017 Information Technology Winners and Losers and Amazonians at the Gate discuss what the team looks for in these two sectors. The two richest hunting grounds for compounders are consumer staples and the software and IT services sub sector What do the compounder s financials look like They possess powerful intangible assets to drive high returns on operating capital plus demonstrate robust steadily growing earnings even in tough times as pricing power and recurring revenues protect the fat gross margins and stable sales respectively. The high returns on operating capital help drive strong free cash flow generation as earnings actually turn into cash. Finally we prefer to see cash flowing back to shareholders rather than wasted on poor acquisitions and a balance sheet that is robust for the long run rather than efficient for the short run. What is the main challenge in deciding whether a company is a compounder It is easy to tell whether a company is profitable today and whether it has compounded in the past. The challenge is to work out whether this will continue or whether the high returns and growth will fade. The first step is to work out why the company has high returns i.e. what the key intangible assets are. Having done that the crucial analysis is around the myriad threats to those assets be they fashion technology environmental or social issues. Even if the conclusion is that the returns are likely to stay high or even improve and the growth should be steady the governance side needs checking as management can easily foil compounding either by underinvestment in search of short term profits or by poor allocation of capital. Meeting management and understanding their incentives can help mitigate the risks of poor management but as in all human endeavours it is far from fool proof. The current late cycle environment may be particularly favourable to compounders Can tobacco companies still compound The key asset of the tobacco industry has been pricing power. An addictive product a concentrated industry and steadily rising taxes that make up most of the purchase price have all combined to drive circa 5% per year pricing. As such the price rises have more than made up for the impact of the tightening regulatory environment over the last 50 years. Our view for now at least is that the recent regulatory noises in the U.S. around reducing nicotine in combustible cigarettes and banning menthol are not a break with this long term pattern as any implementation is likely to take a long while if it occurs at all. What has changed is the introduction of new technology the next generation products be they vaping or heat not burn. While this change may embolden regulators to take firmer action against traditional combustible cigarettes given the availability of alternative nicotine delivery systems the main impact is on competitive dynamics. The new products can upset the historically stable market shares be it Philip Morris International taking 16% of the Japanese market with IQOS or JUUL s vaping product threatening the U.S. incumbents. Our belief is that those with good next generation products should gain share and therefore can compound but that other players cannot. As a result the investible universe within tobacco has shrunk meaning for us that it has fallen to below 10% of the portfolio from its peak of around 25%. Is this a good time to invest in compounders Our view is that compounders are a chronically undervalued asset class thanks to the market s short term and relative focus. If one is taking a medium or long term view we would argue that it is always a good time to invest in compounders. That said there is a case that the current late cycle environment may be particularly favourable since a compounder s ability to preserve earnings in a downturn may become especially valuable. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  2019 has some worrying echoes of 1999. Markets are up strongly despite soggy earnings initial public offering frenzy is back on CNBC as Lyft starts the wave of unicorns heading to market before the music stops and perhaps most alarmingly Goldman Sachs has abolished business dress. Even the Backstreet Boys are back. This may be more anecdotal than scientific but it is all starting to feel rather late cycle and therefore arguably a good time to deploy a late cycle buffer if one is not in place already. After Q1 2019 we are now concerned about both multiples and earnings Applying a bit more rigor at the start of 2018 we were worried about the elevated level of market multiples. By the end of 2018 which saw a combination of a sharp de rating and strong earnings rises our primary worry had shifted over to earnings. After first quarter Q1 2019 which saw double digit returns despite a global economic slowdown we are now anxious about both multiples and earnings. We like to say that the good news is that there are only two ways to lose money in equities if the earnings go away or if the multiple goes away. The bad news right now is that both are under threat. The multiples are a concern as they have bounced back to September levels with the MSCI World Index back above 15x the next 12 months earnings2 as Q1 2019 has reversed the Q4 de rating. It is true that some of the fears that stalked Q4 have faded thanks to the seeming U turn from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the more positive mood music from the U.S. China trade talks but the experience of last year s two market swoons suggests that there is significant downside multiple risk even without any cyclical earnings shock. As for earnings our underlying anxiety is that they may be unsustainably high particularly in the U.S. Margins are near peak levels as are profits share of gross domestic product and the level of earnings per share boosting leverage. Earnings are also drifting down while the market surges up. The 2019 MSCI World Index earnings estimates are off 6.5% since the start of Q4 2018 and 4.0% down year to date.3 In the U.S. where quarterly data is available earnings are actually expected to be down around 3% year on year in Q1.4 The interesting point is the source of the U.S. earnings drop. Revenues are still healthy up around 5% on the year 5 but the margins are falling. Costs are rising in the U.S. notably for labour and many companies are having trouble passing them on. The National Association of Business Economics reported that 58% of respondents were facing higher labour costs but that only 19% had been able to increase prices presumably the 19% with the strongest pricing power. The market as per usual assumes that things will improve. By Q4 2019 consensus has U.S. earnings up nearly 10% year on year as against the Q1 2019 fall.6 Our fear is that this may be over optimistic either due to the late cycle margin pressure or the even later cycle economic downturn. If we are indeed late cycle then a portfolio of compounders seems a reasonable place to hide If we are indeed late cycle and therefore vulnerable to late cycle margin pressure followed by an economic downturn then a portfolio of compounders seems a reasonable place to hide. We believe compounders have sustainable high returns supported by powerful intangible assets. Importantly we also require strong pricing power recurring revenues and limited operational and financial leverage. The pricing power generally fed by powerful brands and networks allows companies to protect their margins when costs rise while the recurring revenues from repeat purchases or long term contracts support the level of sales. The combination of robust sales and robust margins should help drive robust profits particularly if there is limited operational or financial leverage. While of course past performance doesn t guarantee future outcomes we believe the impact of the 2008 09 global financial crisis supports our thesis that compounders can be a late cycle buffer. Our flagship global equity strategy Global Franchise actually saw its earnings rise over the course of the crisis while the market saw a 40% fall. In addition the earnings for the core sectors of our global portfolios today consumer staples software IT services within information technology and health care which combined are over 80% of our global portfolios held up far better than their more cyclical peers as shown in the chart below. NTM Forward EPS Change During Financial Crisis Drawdown Oct 2007 Feb 2009 Source FactSet. Data as of February 28 2019. Chart shown for illustrative purposes only. On forward price to free cash flow our favoured valuation metric our global portfolios trade on only an 18 22% premium to the far lower quality MSCI World Index despite the far higher return on capital gross margins and margin stability. 1 We would argue that this is actually an overstatement of any real premium given the market s chronic failure to deliver the expected forward cash flows and earnings and the habit of tucking any unpleasant news below the line. Our global products look to compound wealth over the long term by owning high quality companies that compound their earnings steadily at reasonable valuations. They look to keep the lights on rather than shooting them out and have been described as a get rich slowly scheme. We would assert that compounders should be owned across the cycle but in particular if the cycle may be coming to an end. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  When investors make asset allocation decisions they need to look at a potential asset class relative to others. The appeal of each asset class story depends not just on its own merit but whether it looks more attractive than other themes in the portfolio and of course how it might affect the remaining holdings based on correlation of returns and risk. When looking at convertible bonds for this purpose we must first recognize that the risk and return is comprised of both underlying equity and credit inputs. Because stocks are typically more volatile than bonds we have found historically that convertible bond performance can sensibly be compared to a balanced portfolio of approximately 60% equity and 40% fixed income. Despite all the vagaries of convertible bonds where we consider delta gamma and other complex sounding characteristics the relative argument for convertibles compared to stocks and bonds can be often boiled down to two expected conditions Convertibles are expected to outperform stocks when volatility is high convertibles contain an embedded equity option that becomes more valuable in volatile stock markets. Convertibles are expected to outperform bonds when interest rates rise rates typically rise when the economy is strong and inflation creeps in so the embedded option in a convertible provides some equity upside potential not found in other bond instruments. As we look ahead to 2019 we consider below the merits of convertible bonds in this context. DISPLAY 1 Convertibles Returns vs 60% Equity 40% Fixed Income Mix Equity is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index. Fixed Income is represented by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Total Return Index Unhedged. Convertible bonds are represented by the Thomson Reuters Global Convertibles Focus Index. Market volatility is represented by the VIX Index. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Fixed income securities are subject to credit risk the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal and interest rate risk fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates . In addition to the risks associated with common stocks investments in convertible securities are subject to the risks associated with fixed income securities namely credit price and interest rate risks. The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Index Definitions section for index definitions. CONVERTIBLES PERFORMANCE AS VOLATILITY RISES In the past three years some investors have wondered if convertibles are dead. We observe in Display 1 where this concern comes from. If we look at the period from January 1 2016 through October 31 2018 equity as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index has delivered a return of 8.26% while fixed income as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Total Return Index has provided a return of 3.17%. So a 60% equity 40% fixed income mix of these indices achieved a return of 6.22%. In this same period convertibles as measured by the Thompson Reuters Global Convertibles Focus Index have delivered a return of only 2.93% underperforming not only the 60 40 mix by a material 3.29% but also both the equity and fixed income components that comprise convertibles risk. It is intuitive that if convertibles comprise both equity and credit risk then the return and risk should be somewhere in between but over this period convertibles unusually underperformed both constituent parts. Thankfully the picture improves if we look to the decade preceding this period. We see in Display 1 that from January 1 2006 through December 31 2015 the 60% equity 40% fixed income mix delivered a return of 5.25% while convertible bonds returned 6.10% an outperformance of 85 basis points bps . In fact over this decade convertible bonds outperformed both the equity and fixed income component parts. Of course we must appreciate that an investor in global convertibles does not own the same mix of individual equity and fixed income securities as the indices but nevertheless the period is sufficiently long enough that it raises questions as to why convertibles have outperformed and then underperformed equities and fixed income over different time horizons. In our view the answer lies primarily in the level of equity volatility. A convertible bond of course is comprised of a regular corporate bond and an equity option an option to convert to a specified number of equity shares. The more volatility there is in the equity market the greater the value of the option. Looking back at Display 1 volatility as measured by the VIX Index was very low in the period from January 1 2016 to October 31 2018 with an average level of just 14.39%. We can compare that to the decade from January 1 2006 to December 31 2016 where we see that the VIX was 20.29%. Simply put in a period of higher volatility convertibles outperformed both equities and fixed income due to the value of the option while the opposite occurred in the period of relative calm and low volatility. DISPLAY 2 Analysis of U.S. Equity and Convertible Bond Returns in Different Volatility Regimes 90 day rolling VIX Source Bloomberg. Data from January 1990 through October 2018. The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Index Definitions section for index definitions. If we now aim to look at an even longer term Display 2 shows the plotted history of the VIX since inception. The VIX takes a forward looking approach to volatility by measuring the prices of options to the next three months expiry. As such the VIX is widely known as the market s fear gauge and can spike very quickly on negative market news. In order to view a smoother picture we show in Display 2 a 90 day rolling average of VIX levels going back to 1990. Overall we observe that the average level of VIX since inception is 19.26% In the past three years stocks benefitted from the slow and steady recovery in the global economy where economic data and corporate earnings rose consistently. Volatility was accordingly low as we see above the average VIX of 14.39% is far below the long term average of 19.26% and so convertibles were soundly beaten by directional equity investments. However in the decade before that which of course included the credit crisis of 2008 average volatility was higher than the long term at 20.26% making convertibles a better investment than equities as downside was protected in choppy markets. Looking further at Display 2 we update work from our forecast at this time last year where we gather VIX data into 4% wide regimes to make it easier to observe. We note the following In the very low volatility regime of 13% for the VIX both equities 274 bps per month return on average and convertibles 219 bps perform well but as expected equities are better due to implied strong equity markets and a drag from the cost of the embedded option in convertibles. Equities continue to outperform until the VIX regime rises above 17 and then convertibles outperformed thereafter. VIX above 17 occurred 50% of the time in the sample since VIX inception in 1990. The historical average for VIX of 19.26 sits in the middle of the 17 21 regime shown in the table. Here convertibles outperformed equities with an average historical monthly return of 57 bps vs 28 bps for equities. For us the punchline is that convertibles are not dead we believe they have just been sleeping. While equity markets have enjoyed an easy ride since 2016 volatility has been low and it has made sense to be overweight pure equities. But if we look to the decade before and indeed even use the long run average for equity market volatility convertibles have outperformed equities. As we have seen in the latter stages of 2018 equity volatility looks to be back and on that basis we see convertibles as a better bet than equities looking forward to 2019. DISPLAY 3 Performance of Convertibles as Rates Rise and Fall Source Bloomberg. Data from March 1998 through September 2018. Convertible bonds are represented by the Thomson Reuters Global Convertibles Focus Index. UST 10yr is represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Generic Government 10 Year Yield Index. The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Index Definitions section for index definitions 2. CONVERTIBLES PERFORMANCE AS RATES RISE For convertibles a look at equity volatility is incomplete without considering interest rates because as mentioned above convertibles are clearly a hybrid investment of bond plus equity option. The interplay of volatility and rising rates therefore has more relevance for convertible than even equities. Convertibles offer a hedge against rising rates for two reasons i They are relatively short duration because issuers do not like giving long term conversion options on their stock and ii the asset class historically has typically provided positive returns when rates go up simply because the return profile is driven more from the embedded equity option. Usually when rates are going up it is because the economy is performing well and central banks raise rates to manage inflation. In this context equity markets often rise and convertibles benefit too. To test this in Display 3 we also update work we did in an earlier article. Here we analyze all of the months over the past 20 years when U.S. 10 year Treasury rates rose 25 bps or more and observe that U.S. convertibles rose an average of 3.05%. Conversely in months when the U.S. 10 year rate fell 25 bps or more average U.S. convertibles returns were 1.89%. Intuitively this makes sense as convertibles losses in these times from rising rates on the bond side are more than offset by rising optionality on the equity side. Therefore convertibles offer diversification benefits to fixed income investors as rates are poised to rise further into 2019. DISPLAY 4 Global Convertible Valuations as at October 31 2018 Source DB convertibles.com 3. CONVERTIBLE MARKET VALUATIONS In our view the table is set for convertibles to recover from underperformance versus stocks and bonds since 2016 as both volatility and rates are clearly on the rise. The next consideration is to evaluate the health of the market in terms of both valuations and supply. In Display 4 we observe that valuations are right around what we consider to be fair value where the U.S. trades 75 bps cheap Asia is 38 bps cheap and Europe is 2 bps cheap. This means that using current market levels for credit spread and volatility for each bond in the universe the average theoretical price is very close to the price where the bonds trade in the market. Investors may query the accuracy of a fair value measure that uses current market inputs that may themselves be mispriced. To this end we would agree that credit spreads look tight but volatility inputs are low given the quiet in markets until recent times so in our view these effects net off and the fair value measure is a good gauge of where bonds should trade. If the market trades at fair value that implies that supply and demand are therefore in line which makes sense as both metrics have picked up in the current year. As at October 31 2018 supply for the year was $78 billion USD which exceeded all of 2017 and was the highest pace in five years.1 When supply is higher we often see the market cheapen but it has maintained a level around fair value as demand has risen to meet supply. Throughout 2018 we saw inflows to the asset class as investors likely saw the merits of the scenario around rising rates and volatility. Another important technical observation is that currently the market is trading right around par. In Display 4 we see that all three major regions are trading between 99.5% and 100% of par. It is rare to see the global convertible market looking like the day it was born trading both at our estimation of fair value and at par. This has appeal to investors as they can participate in the asset class without the biases of expensive valuations and or at in the money prices. 4. GLOBAL VERSUS REGIONAL APPROACH If we dig deeper and look at the data per region however we do observe some important differences. Again looking at Display 4 we observe that both equity risk and credit risk are higher in the U.S. than other markets. As of October 31 2018 U.S. regional equity delta i.e. sensitivity to the underlying stock price was 52% around 20 points higher than Europe 32% and Asia 31% . This makes sense as equities have performed better in the U.S. in recent years so the convertibles universe is now deeper in the money. On the credit side we observe a key difference between the U.S. and Rest of World where credit spreads in the U.S. approximate the high yield market due to the fact that far more issuers are smaller cap growth companies. In Display 4 we observe a U.S. regional credit spread of 577 bps far above Europe 256 bps and Asia 125 bps . This can be very appealing in a strong bull market as the investor doubles down on both equity and credit risk but of course it comes at the cost of less bond feature in more uncertain times. In addition to regional disparities on delta and spread investors should also be aware that the U.S. only represents half of a small market. As we always tell our clients why look at 500 securities for best ideas when you can look at 1 000 In an asset class where we need to optimize on three metrics equity credit and technicals we typically like around 15% of the market. If we buy U.S. only that only gives us 50 75 ideas and these are concentrated in a few sectors. Summary We must acknowledge that we also made the case for convertibles relative to both stocks as volatility rises and credit as rates rise at the beginning of 2018. And convertibles have indeed provided reduced downside participation Through October 31 2018 the 60 equity 40 fixed income mix delivered a loss year to date of 3.79% while convertibles returned 1.17% an outperformance of 262 bps. Heading into 2019 we still maintain some optimism for equities as we believe markets became oversold in Q4 2018 while earnings and profits are still growing particularly in sectors such as technology biotech and consumer where the convertibles market is concentrated. We do however acknowledge that all equity and credit markets face more headwinds than a year ago so our absolute return expectations are more muted in the mid single digits. But as they say It s all relative so in 2019 convertibles certainly are lined up to be one of the more appealing asset classes and therefore offer an additional useful tool for asset allocators. Risk Considerations Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. The value of convertible securities tends to decline as interest rates rise and because of the conversion feature tends to vary with fluctuations in the market value of the underlying securities. Convertible securities ordinarily provide a stream of income with generally higher yields than those of common stock of the same or similar issuers. Convertible securities generally rank senior to common stock in a corporation s capital structure but are usually subordinated to comparable nonconvertible securities. Convertible securities generally do not participate directly in any dividend increases or decreases of the underlying securities although the market prices of convertible securities may be affected by any dividend changes or other changes in the underlying securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. \n",
      "Doc - Lemmatized:   when investor make asset allocation decision need to look at a potential asset class relative to other . the appeal of each asset class story depend not just on own merit but whether look more attractive than other theme in the portfolio and of course how might affect the remain holding base on correlation of return and risk . when look at convertible bond for this purpose must first recognize that the risk and return be comprise of both underlie equity and credit input . because stock be typically more volatile than bond have find historically that convertible bond performance can sensibly be compare to a balanced portfolio of approximately 60 % equity and 40 % fixed income . despite all the vagary of convertible bond where consider delta gamma and other complex sound characteristic the relative argument for convertible compare to stock and bond can be often boil down to two expect condition convertibles be expect to outperform stock when volatility be high convertible contain an embed equity option that become more valuable in volatile stock market . convertible be expect to outperform bond when interest rate rise rate typically rise when the economy be strong and inflation creep in so the embed option in a convertible provide some equity upside potential not find in other bond instrument . as look ahead to 2019 consider below the merit of convertible bond in this context . display 1 convertibles returns vs 60 % equity 40 % fixed income mix equity be represent by the msci all country world index . fixed income be represent by the bloomberg barclays global aggregate total return index unhedged . convertible bond be represent by the thomson reuters global convertibles focus index . market volatility be represent by the vix index . in general equity security value also fluctuate in response to activity specific to a company . fix income security be subject to credit risk the ability of an issuer to make timely payment of interest and principal and interest rate risk fluctuation in the value of a fixed income security result from change in the general level of interest rate . in addition to the risk associate with common stock investment in convertible security be subject to the risk associate with fix income security namely credit price and interest rate risk . the index performance be provide for illustrative purpose only and be not mean to depict the performance of a specific investment . past performance be no guarantee of future result . see index definitions section for index definition . convertibles performance as volatility rises in the past three year some investor have wonder if convertible be dead . observe in display 1 where this concern come from . if look at the period from january 1 2016 through october 31 2018 equity as measure by the msci all country world index have deliver a return of 8.26 % while fix income as measure by the bloomberg barclays global aggregate total return index have provide a return of 3.17 % . so a 60 % equity 40 % fixed income mix of these index achieve a return of 6.22 % . in this same period convertible as measure by the thompson reuters global convertibles focus index have deliver a return of only 2.93 % underperform not only the 60 40 mix by a material 3.29 % but also both the equity and fix income component that comprise convertible risk . be intuitive that if convertible comprise both equity and credit risk then the return and risk should be somewhere in between but over this period convertible unusually underperform both constituent part . thankfully the picture improve if look to the decade precede this period . see in display 1 that from january 1 2006 through december 31 2015 the 60 % equity 40 % fixed income mix deliver a return of 5.25 % while convertible bond return 6.10 % an outperformance of 85 basis point bps . in fact over this decade convertible bond outperform both the equity and fix income component part . of course must appreciate that an investor in global convertible do not own the same mix of individual equity and fix income security as the index but nevertheless the period be sufficiently long enough that raise question as to why convertible have outperform and then underperformed equity and fixed income over different time horizon . in view the answer lie primarily in the level of equity volatility . a convertible bond of course be comprise of a regular corporate bond and an equity option an option to convert to a specified number of equity share . the more volatility there be in the equity market the great the value of the option . look back at display 1 volatility as measure by the vix index be very low in the period from january 1 2016 to october 31 2018 with an average level of just 14.39 % . can compare that to the decade from january 1 2006 to december 31 2016 where see that the vix be 20.29 % . simply put in a period of high volatility convertible outperform both equity and fixed income due to the value of the option while the opposite occur in the period of relative calm and low volatility . display 2 analysis of u.s. equity and convertible bond returns in

show the plot history of the vix since inception . the vix take a forward look approach to volatility by measure the price of option to the next three month expiry . as such the vix be widely know as the market s fear gauge and can spike very quickly on negative market news . in order to view a smoother picture show in display 2 a 90 day roll average of vix level go back to 1990 . overall observe that the average level of vix since inception be 19.26 % in the past three year stock benefit from the slow and steady recovery in the global economy where economic datum and corporate earning rise consistently . volatility be accordingly low as see above the average vix of 14.39 % be far below the long term average of 19.26 % and so convertible be soundly beat by directional equity investment . however in the decade before that which of course include the credit crisis of 2008 average volatility be high than the long term at 20.26 % make convertible a well investment than equity as downside be protect in choppy market . look further at display 2 update work from forecast at this time last year where gather vix datum into 4 % wide regime to make easy to observe . note the following in the very low volatility regime of 13 % for the vix both equity 274 bps per month return on average and convertible 219 bps perform well but as expect equity be better due to imply strong equity market and a drag from the cost of the embed option in convertible . equity continue to outperform until the vix regime rise above 17 and then convertible outperform thereafter . vix above 17 occur 50 % of the time in the sample since vix inception in 1990 . the historical average for vix of 19.26 sit in the middle of the 17 21 regime show in the table . here convertible outperform equity with an average historical monthly return of 57 bps vs 28 bps for equity . for the punchline be that convertible be not dead believe have just be sleep . while equity market have enjoy an easy ride since 2016 volatility have be low and have make sense to be overweight pure equity . but if look to the decade before and indeed even use the long run average for equity market volatility convertible have outperform equity . as have see in the latter stage of 2018 equity volatility look to be back and on that basis see convertible as a well bet than equity look forward to 2019 . display 3 performance

      "Doc - Orig:  It is no secret that the industrial sector has been the darling of the current commercial real estate cycle especially over the last 5 years. Looking at NCREIF returns by property type industrial is the only property type that saw stronger annualized returns in 2014 2018 than in 2011 2013. Moreover relative to NCREIF s NPI index the industrial property type has outperformed the broader U.S. commercial real estate market by more than 400 basis points annually since 2014. DISPLAY 1 Pronounced Industrial Outperformance Since 2014 Source NCREIF MSREI Strategy data as of February 2019 This paper aims to explore the key trends driving the industrial market. We will analyze the current drivers of demand and rent growth as well as how emerging technologies such as autonomous trucking may affect the market. Current Trends Over the last 5 years 2014 2018 industrial net absorption in the U.S. has been remarkably strong with an average of 260MM square feet of space absorbed annually during this period a 40% increase over the annual average between 2003 and 2007. Moreover the growth rate of total industrial occupancy has accelerated from 1.5% per annum over 2003 2007 to 1.8% per annum over the last 5 years. Analyzing the recent trends in industrial space demand we believe that an emphasis on supply chain efficiency in recent years has driven tenants into large exurban properties in the nation s major logistics hubs. DISPLAY 2 Robust Demand Growth Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of November 2018 Big Box Demand Big Box users defined here as those larger than 200 000 square feet have driven overall net absorption throughout this cycle. Since 2014 67% of net absorption has been concentrated in properties larger than 200 000 square feet with these properties capturing 72% of net absorption in 2018. Propelling this trend is an increased emphasis among tenants on optimizing their national supply chains through fewer but larger and more centrally located warehouses. The trend towards Big Box industrial has largely concentrated in key logistics markets which we define as having relatively high stock of industrial space relative to local consumption. Generally the key logistics markets possess large pools of labor. Additionally the key logistics markets typically include the presence of major infrastructure e.g. Riverside Chicago and Dallas or a combination of low cost labor cheap land and accessibility towards large consumption markets e.g. Central Pennsylvania to New York and Stockton to San Francisco . Moreover the rise in e commerce has supported growth in Midwestern metros like Columbus and Cincinnati which can provide one day air and two day ground delivery to a large swath of the country. DISPLAY 3 Net Absorption by Property Size Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of November 2018 Exurban Despite the popular narrative surrounding Urban Infill industrial tenants have increasingly preferred lower cost exurban submarkets as they seek to maximize profitability. Analyzing nearly 2 600 submarkets we characterized each submarket by their population density assigning each submarket as Urban Higher Density suburban Lower Density suburban or Exurban.1 We found that 80% of logistics net absorption since 2007 has been in exurban submarkets while exurban submarkets account for only 60% of stock. Over this period higher density submarkets including both urban and higher density suburbs have captured 1% of net absorption. DISPLAY 4 Big Box Logistics Demand Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of June 2018 We believe this trend towards growth in lower density submarkets is the result of tenants seeking to maximize their bottom line by lowering occupancy costs. Developers have taken notice with nearly all development since 2014 occurring in lower density suburban and exurban submarkets. Meanwhile urban submarkets have lost industrial stock as developers repurposed older warehouses into higher value uses like residential and office. To validate further the exurban net absorption trends we analyzed the location of over 300 million square feet of space leased to Amazon Walmart FedEx and UPS to glean occupancy trends since these companies are some of the most sophisticated users of industrial space. Our findings show that Amazon and Walmart are highly active in leasing space in exurban big boxes. For example 65% of Amazon s warehouses are over 200 000 square feet with 45% larger than 500 000 square feet while 77% of Amazon s total industrial footprint is located in the exurbs. Walmart favors the exurbs even more with 90% of its footprint located in these submarkets. While the parcel carriers show more balance among the submarket types they still are both slightly over represented in exurban submarkets and slightly under represented in urban submarkets.2 For urban and higher density suburban submarkets a general lack of modern supply may have contributed to lower net absorption. In these higher density submarkets which are predominately located in Southern California Chicago and New York 3 product instead tends to be older and less efficient. For example in the submarkets of Queens and Brooklyn which collectively hold 175 million square feet of industrial space just 1% of inventory meets a loose definition of modern stock .4 In contrast 48% of the Exit 8A submarket and 38% of stock in the exurban Lehigh Valley meets this criterion of modern stock .5 While lack of land will likely continue to limit development in urban infill locations rising rents may support renovating older warehouses to take advantage of tight market conditions in these locations. DISPLAY 5 Cumulative Occupied Space Growth Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of November 2018 Market Matters More than Submarket Despite the supply constraints of higher density submarkets our analysis does not find meaningfully higher rent growth in these submarkets after accounting for market wide factors and even found instances where exurban submarkets outperformed infill submarkets within the same market. For example in the New York metro Exit 8A an exurban submarket approximately a hour drive from Midtown Manhattan saw annualized rent growth of 7.7% over the last 5 years while Queens and Brooklyn urban submarkets posted rent gains of 7.1% per year over the same period.6 Our analysis therefore suggests that market selection matters much more than infill vs. suburban location. Variations in rent growth are significantly greater across markets rather than within markets. Similarly an analysis of submarket rent growth based on proximity to infrastructure seaports airports and intermodal terminals also shows that there is not significant variation. DISPLAY 6 Major Industrial Tenant Occupancy Patterns Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of December 2018 Emerging Trends While we expect industrial net absorption to moderate as the U.S. economy downshifts we think several emerging trends may influence the utilization and location of warehouses. These trends may also drive greater cost efficiencies i.e. labor transportation which could offset higher rents as tenants look to optimize profitability with proximity to the consumer. While these technologies overlap we see three distinct areas where technological innovations will likely affect the supply chain. DISPLAY 7 Rent Growth Variation Across and Within Markets Source CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of January 2019 First warehouse automation and big data analytics are changing supply chains and how companies utilize their warehouses. Big data in the supply chain allows companies to build better demand forecasts lowering turnaround times and optimizing delivery networks.7 These advances will continue to drive the shift towards larger more centralized distribution networks and modern efficient warehouses. Moreover lower turnaround times may allow for leaner inventories which ultimately could reduce the need for warehouse space relative to total sales. Predictive analytics and warehouse efficiency will be crucial for companies reducing shipping times which may further enhance the use of the hub and spoke model. Second for the most sophisticated supply chains the next frontier is increased automation of warehouse picking operations through robotics. For example Amazon s warehouses which employ 100 000 robots alongside 125 000 humans are nearly 50% more efficient than the average retailer s.8 Improved warehouse efficiency all other things being equal reduces the need for logistics space with Morgan Stanley Research estimating that Amazon s newer warehouses can handle the same freight capacity with 30% fewer square feet.9 Moreover they estimate that only 14% of Amazon fulfillment centers are currently utilizing robotics. With Amazon occupying an estimated 140 million square feet of logistics space this increased utilization would reduce their occupancy needs by more than 35 million square feet. While we doubt Amazon would actually vacate this space improved efficiencies may slow their take up rate of new occupancy in the near to mid term. DISPLAY 8 Warehouse Output Source Bureau of Economic Analysis CoStar MSREI Strategy data as of June 2018 Higher levels of automation could also reduce the need for labor. Today finding enough labor to staff a warehouse is a major challenge for companies especially with historically tight labor market conditions. However with more automation smaller workforces may be capable of supporting larger warehouses. DISPLAY 9 Amazon On the Forefront of Utilization Source Census Bureau Moody s Analytics Morgan Stanley Research MWPVL International Costar Corporate filings MSREI Strategy data as of June 2018 Advances in robotics and analytics will also affect the supply chain through the development of autonomous trucking. McKinsey expects that the technology will emerge in four stages. They envision that the first and second stages will develop over the next several years and focus on platooning . At first drivers will remain in each truck but wireless connections between vehicles will allow them to operate closer together and reduce fuel costs. The second stage of platooning which they expect to occur over 2020 2025 will keep a driver in the lead truck with unmanned vehicles following closely behind. They estimate the use of platooning can reduce costs by approximately 11%. They call the third stage constrained autonomy and imagine that autonomous trucks will drive themselves on interstate highways at dedicated truck stops near urban centers where human drivers would take over. McKinsey expects this to develop over 2025 2027 and lower costs by an additional 9%. Finally starting in 2027 they anticipate full autonomy will emerge with trucks driving autonomously along all highways. They expect full autonomy to lower cost another 25%.10 DISPLAY 10 Venture Capital Funding Source PWC MoneyTree Pitchbook National Venture Capital Association as of June 2018 We anticipate several impacts from autonomous trucking. Proximity to highways particularly interstate highways may become a vital requirement for logistics tenants. Additionally autonomous trucks may reduce the need for logistics tenants to locate near intermodal facilities as lower trucking costs may reduce intermodal freight demand. Warehouse operations may also move further away from higher cost infill locations as the cost of transportation falls. Finally given autonomy will increase the distance a truck can travel in a given day from 500 to 1 000 miles centrally located markets may see increased demand. Third we expect that advanced manufacturing will influence the source of production and thus has the potential to shift supply chains with more manufacturing occurring in the United States. With speed to market becoming increasingly important and now seen by manufacturers as a key differentiator we believe that advanced manufacturing techniques i.e. 3D printing industrial robotics and virtual reality assisted manufacturing will become a major force in the supply chain. This will likely increase warehouse demand in key manufacturing locations particularly in the southeastern United States. One example is Adidas decision to open its Speedfactory in Atlanta.11 By placing factories closer to consumers Adidas could ostensibly leapfrog over shipping delays and expenses .12 Conversely advanced manufacturing may also reduce how much space tenants need. For example 3 D printing may reduce the need for bulky manufacturing infrastructure and quicker lead times for products may reduce the need to carry larger inventories DISPLAY 11 Use of Industrial Robots Still Ramping Up Source International Federation of Robotics as of June 2018 Conclusion Overall we expect demand for industrial space to remain above historical levels driven by continued growth in e commerce manufacturing and an expanding economy. We expect to see more divergence in market performance as tenants become more selective on location and believe exurban locations within the most attractive markets will optimize tenant profitability with a desire to be close to the consumer. The emergence of new technologies will lower the overall cost basis for warehouse users which could potentially enable logistics tenants to allocate the incremental savings to rent in higher quality and better located warehouse facilities. Meanwhile other secular trends such as shifts in consumption towards e commerce increases in local production and just in time distribution should continue to boost industrial demand. The current and emerging trends in how industrial tenants seek to maximize the value of their real estate and drive space efficiencies likely favors the use of large exurban sites with good connectivity to large consumption markets. \n",

from high cost infill location as the cost of transportation fall . finally give autonomy will increase the distance a truck can travel in a give day from 500 to 1 000 mile centrally locate market may see increase demand . third expect that advanced manufacturing will influence the source of production and thus have the potential to shift supply chain with more manufacturing occur in the united states . with speed to market become increasingly important and now see by manufacturer as a key differentiator believe that advanced manufacturing technique i.e. 3d print industrial robotic and virtual reality assist manufacturing will become a major force in the supply chain . this will likely increase warehouse demand in key manufacturing location particularly in the southeastern united states . one example be adidas decision to open speedfactory in atlanta.11 by place factory closer to consumer adidas could ostensibly leapfrog over shipping delay and expense .12 conversely advanced manufacturing may also reduce how much space tenant need . for example 3 d printing may reduce the need for bulky manufacturing infrastructure and quick lead time for product may reduce the need to carry large inventory display 11 use of industrial robot still ramp up source international federation of robotics as of june 2018 conclusion overall expect demand for industrial space to remain above historical level drive by continued growth in e commerce manufacturing and an expand economy . expect to see more divergence in market performance as tenant become more selective on location and believe exurban location within the most attractive market will optimize tenant profitability with a desire to be close to the consumer . the emergence of new technology will lower the overall cost basis for warehouse user which could potentially enable logistic tenant to allocate the incremental saving to rent in high quality and better locate warehouse facility . meanwhile other secular trend such as shift in consumption towards e commerce increase in local production and just in time distribution should continue to boost industrial demand . the current and emerge trend in how industrial tenant seek to maximize the value of real estate and drive space efficiency likely favor the use of large exurban site with good connectivity to large consumption market .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  On Thursday May 2 a story form China s Global Times leaked that U.S. China talks hit an impasse. The market reacted negatively that day but the following day strong nonfarm payroll numbers turned the market in a more positive direction. The timeline matters. Three days following the May 2 story leak President Trump tweeted that tariffs may rise from 10% 25% on $200 billion of goods. This implies that Trump is trying to control the narrative and get ahead of the story. What s at stake for China Morgan Stanley economists believe this could shave 0.3% from China s gross domestic product GDP putting China on the threshold of falling below 6% growth something President Xi Jingping expressly wants to avoid. As a result China is likely to add more stimulus as they have already announced cuts to reserve requirement ratio could do a lot more. Global market impact is still idiosyncratic and NOT YET a systemic event. Risk premia has risen marginally. U.S. equity prices have declined and U.S. Treasury bond yields have decreased by 2 4 basis points bps .1 The U.S. dollar has marginally appreciated. Emerging market debt spreads have widened by 5 bps to 365 bps.2 U.S. investment grade spread have widened by 2 4 bps with a 112 bps option adjusted spread OAS that is still near tights of the year.3 U.S. high yield spread widened by 5 bps with a 360 bps OAS that is still near tights of the year.4 What are we watching We are keeping an eye on the U.S. dollar as a stronger dollar would signal heightened tensions outflows from riskier assets and further escalation in U.S. China tensions. What are we doing as fixed income investors We are staying the course. At this point the market reaction has been minor. However it is important to note that China stimulus and stability is critical to world growth for remainder of 2019. If U.S. China talks break down risk premia will rise and global growth will be unlikely to recover further in 2019. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks.

      "Doc - Orig:  Expectations for easier Fed policy are boosting asset valuations because it is lowering the interest rate their cash flows are discounted at. In addition since potential rate cuts from the Fed are viewed as insurance to stave off an economic downturn then asset values get an added boost because lower policy rates are reducing the risk of recession that would typically increase default risk and put those cash flows at risk. Lower rates and reducing recession risk explains much of the upward repricing of riskier assets. Our Investment Strategy Most of the investment returns attributed to long duration in our portfolios have already been recognized for this year. We believe insurance rate cuts from the Fed are mostly priced in and returns attribution in fixed income may be generated by carry and spread narrowing for the remainder of the year. Our focus remains on the real economy and the strength of the consumer in both investment grade and high yield credit. Financials building materials gaming and delevering themes in communications remain key sectors for us. Our largest exposure remains in non agency mortgages and asset backed securities due to strong credit fundamentals in select areas within this asset class. What is the Bond Market Telling Us Well... It depends which bond market you are talking about. The U.S. Treasuries UST market is pricing a recession in 12 months. Credit high yield is pricing an extension of the economic expansion low recession risk low default risk . The bond market indicates that lower UST rates are increasing the valuations of riskier assets. Where will UST yields level out If we take at face value the market expectation for rate cuts close to 100 basis points then we believe the UST 2 year yield could fall to within a range of 1.50% 1.75%. The yield curve should have some slope if these cuts serve as an insurance policy against rising recession risks 2s10s 25 50 basis points. This leaves the UST 10 year yield in a range of 1.75% 2.25%. We believe these levels are fair and reasonable based on what we know right now. Lower yield expectations require a more negative economic outlook than is currently priced and vice versa for higher yields. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  It is probably fraught with peril to make any forecasts about U.K. politics given the turbulence of the last few years. However it does seem that the room for a compromise deal between the U.K. and the European Union EU is closing. The European elections saw the rise of the two extremes in the Brexit debate with the No Deal parties dominated by Nigel Farage s new Brexit Party getting 35% of the vote and the explicit Remain parties led by the Liberal Democrats scoring 40%. This left less than a quarter of the vote for the two major U.K. parties who were pushing for a compromise deal with Labour getting 14% and the Conservatives 9% a collapse versus the combined 82% they accounted for in the General Election only two years ago. While Conservative leadership elections are notoriously difficult to forecast it is looking likely that the next party leader and thus the next prime minister will favour No Deal or at least rule out an extension beyond October 31 which effectively amounts to the same thing given that the EU will be tied up with selecting the new commission for the next few months. The issue is whether the British parliament will be able to block this outcome given its current majority against No Deal. This is a journey into the unknown as the U.K. enters uncharted constitutional waters. Ultimately it is looking increasingly like a binary choice between No Deal and a decision to Remain be it via a general election a referendum or even a revocation of Article 50... unpredictable indeed. While far from optimal for the U.K. the impact on our global portfolios is likely to be relatively minor Without wishing to be accused of participating in Project Fear No Deal is likely to be a significant economic shock for the U.K. and also a bump for Continental Europe. The extent of any damage will depend on how long it takes for some sort of accommodation to be reached i.e. No Deal to be replaced with some kind of deal. There is also likely to be a sharp depreciation of sterling. While far from optimal for the U.K. the impact on our global portfolios is likely to be relatively minor. Optically there is plenty of exposure with 19 22% of the portfolios listed in the U.K. But these U.K. listed companies are global meaning that the actual economic exposure is far lower with only 3 4% of the portfolios revenue U.K. exposed. As such any sterling weakness is likely to be matched by sterling share price appreciation in the U.K. listed stocks as was the case after the 2016 referendum result. In the case of a British based multinational tobacco company it can be argued that any sterling weakness will be positive as it would effectively reduce the strain from the debt load 40% sterling denominated and the dividend 100% sterling denominated helping the company de lever and making the company a No Deal hedge of sorts There is a similar argument that a distinctly cheaper sterling will help with GlaxoSmithKline s U.K. centric cost base. The further issue is whether a No Deal outcome would be a general Risk Off event. Unlike the aftermath of the 2016 referendum there is unlikely to be any fears of contagion or a domino effect as the U.K. s experience over the last three years has definitely dimmed enthusiasm for similar moves elsewhere in Europe. However there will be concerns about the impact on U.K. and Continental European growth. Our global portfolios invest in companies with plenty of recurring revenue and pricing power which should make their economics more robust in any downturn as both sales and margins tend to be insulated and history suggests that this is likely to be recognised by the market. While we are relatively sanguine about the effects of Brexit and or No Deal on the portfolio we are less relaxed about political risk in general. The Brexit process can be seen as a symptom of the shift of the global environment away from business friendly policies after all for good or ill it was far from supported by large corporates. It can be argued that the last few decades have seen governments favour capital over labour be it around globalisation workplace regulation taxation or attitudes to consolidation. This is reflected in corporate profitability which is at very high levels as a share of gross domestic product particularly in the U.S. where its share is at around 10% as against the post war norm of around 6%. US Post Tax Corporate Profits as % GDP Source BEA MSIM Analysis as of December 31 2018 There are three broad and overlapping strands of political threat to the current high levels of profitability right wing populism left wing populism and the environmental movement. Between them they are the main structural challenge to the current elevated levels of profitability as opposed to the cyclical threat from any downturn or recession. There are three strands of political threat to the current levels of profitability right wing populism left wing populism and the environmental movement. Right wing populism is the one that has already started to bite. Brexit is in this strand as are the threats to free trade and globalisation. Trump is often seen as the personification of the anti globalisation backlash but it has been far broader than that. According to the World Trade Organisation 2008 2016 saw 1 300 trade restrictive measures introduced globally even before Trump s election. Pressure has risen since then. In the absence of the pricing power to pass the incremental costs on to customers the U.S. tariffs are already hitting profitability and the uncertainty is not ideal for business investment. Arguably the potential splitting of global technology value chains into separate U.S. and China centric realms could have more serious long term implications than higher tariffs. There are also rising constraints on international migration making recruiting more difficult for corporates in countries with tight labour markets and or skill shortages. It is notable that right wing populism has been far more successful than the left since the Global Financial Crisis. In fact the centre left has really struggled in most Western countries seeing its vote fall sharply or even collapse below 10% in the case of France. This failure is driving more radical policy ideas on the left notably amongst many of the Democratic candidates for the U.S. presidential election in 2020. Ideas include reforms to the labour markets around higher minimum wages or expanded workers rights a revival of anti trust policies to fight increased market concentration and even in the U.K. renationalisation of some industries without full compensation for the current owners. In addition the rise of unorthodox Modern Monetary Theory is providing some intellectual cover for sharply higher government spending funded by printing money which may threaten the low inflation that underpins equity valuations. The prospects for the introduction of any of these policies are unclear but an economic downturn could raise the risks. The third strand is around environmental pressures. Scientific consensus is that actually delivering the undertakings of the 2016 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperatures less than two degrees centigrade above pre industrial levels could have severe implications for carbon intensive industries. What is notable is the increasing traction that environmental parties are having electorally winning close to 10% of the seats in the recent European elections. The unknown is how fast this electoral progress will translate into policies that constrain corporate action. It is far from clear that current market valuations fully incorporate these risks to the equity markets. An MSCI World Index trading on close to 15x the forward earnings for the next 12 months does not seem to be pricing in many of these structural threats to corporate profitability even putting aside any cyclical concerns. Moving down to the portfolio level these threats emphasise the importance of the Environmental and Social lenses within ESG analysis. These need to be primarily considered at an individual stock or industry level but there are some general guidelines. Scrutiny of corporates is rising sharply managements need to be aware of the ESG risks facing their businesses The most important is the existence of pricing power. This is a key characteristic for the compounders in our portfolios but is particularly important where companies cost bases may experience shocks be it due to tariffs higher labour costs or more expensive energy. The ability to pass these input costs on to customers is crucial for preserving margins and thus profitability. Amongst the other factors to look for we would point to the advantage of relatively short and simple supply chains in a world where globalisation is under threat and the need to avoid dependence on carbon intensive processes. More broadly in a world where scrutiny of corporates by both governments and consumers is rising sharply managements need to be aware of the Environmental and Social risks facing their businesses and proactive in dealing with them. There is clearly no room for complacency in this emerging political environment. However our view is that our investment process focussed on compounders with full ESG integration delivers a portfolio of companies that are relatively well placed to deal with these risks be it due to their pricing power their carbon lightness or the quality of management. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

meaning that the actual economic exposure be far low with only 3 4 % of the portfolio revenue u.k. expose . as such any sterling weakness be likely to be match by sterling share price appreciation in the u.k. list stock as be the case after the 2016 referendum result . in the case of a british base multinational tobacco company can be argue that any sterling weakness will be positive as would effectively reduce the strain from the debt load 40 % sterling denominate and the dividend 100 % sterling denominate help the company de lever and make the company a no deal hedge of sort there be a similar argument that a distinctly cheap sterling will help with glaxosmithkline s u.k. centric cost base . the further issue be whether a no deal outcome would be a general risk off event . unlike the aftermath of the 2016 referendum there be unlikely to be any fear of contagion or a domino effect as the u.k. s experience over the last three year have definitely dim enthusiasm for similar move elsewhere in europe . however there will be concern about the impact on u.k. and continental european growth . global portfolio invest in company with plenty of recur revenue and pricing power which should make economic more robust in any downturn as both sale and margin tend to be insulate and history suggest that this be likely to be recognise by the market . while be relatively sanguine about the effect of brexit and or no deal on the portfolio be less relaxed about political risk in general . the brexit process can be see as a symptom of the shift of the global environment away from business friendly policy after all for good or ill be far from support by large corporate . can be argue that the last few decade have see government favour capital over labour be around globalisation workplace regulation taxation or attitude to consolidation . this be reflect in corporate profitability which be at very high level as a share of gross domestic product particularly in the u.s. where share be at around 10 % as against the post war norm of around 6 % . us post tax corporate profit as % gdp source bea msim analysis as of december 31 2018 there be three broad and overlapping strand of political threat to the current high level of profitability right wing populism leave wing populism and the environmental movement . between be the main structural challenge to the current elevated level of profitability as oppose to the cyclical threat from any downturn or recession . there be three strand of political threat to the current level of profitability right wing populism leave wing populism and the environmental movement . right wing populism be the one that have already start to bite . brexit be in this strand as be the threat to free trade and globalisation . trump be often see as the personification of the anti globalisation backlash but have be far broad than that . accord to the world trade organisation 2008 2016 see 1 300 trade restrictive measure introduce globally even before trump s election . pressure have rise since then . in the absence of the pricing power to pass the incremental cost on to customer the u.s. tariff be already hit profitability and the uncertainty be not ideal for business investment . arguably the potential splitting of global technology value chain into separate u.s. and china centric realm could have more serious long term implication than high tariff . there be also rise constraint on international migration make recruit more difficult for corporate in country with tight labour market and or skill shortage . be notable that right wing populism have be far more successful than the left since the global financial crisis . in fact the centre left have really struggle in most western country see vote fall sharply or even collapse below 10 % in the case of france . this failure be drive more radical policy idea on the left notably amongst many of the democratic candidate for the u.s. presidential election in 2020 . idea include reform to the labour market around high minimum wage or expand worker right a revival of anti trust policy to fight increase market concentration and even in the u.k. renationalisation of some industry without full compensation for the current owner . in addition the rise of unorthodox modern monetary theory be provide some intellectual cover for sharply high government spending fund by print money which may threaten the low inflation that underpin equity valuation . the prospect for the introduction of any of these policy be unclear but an economic downturn could raise the risk . the third strand be around environmental pressure . scientific consensus be that actually deliver the undertaking of the 2016 paris agreement to keep the rise in global temperature less than two degree centigrade above pre industrial level could have severe implication for carbon intensive industry . what be notable be the increase traction that environmental party be have electorally win close to 10 % of the seat in the recent european election . the unknown be how fast this electoral progress will translate into policy that constrain corporate action . be far from clear that current market valuation fully incorporate these risk to the equity market . an msci world index trading on close to 15x the forward earning for the next 12 month do not seem to be price in many of these structural threat to corporate profitability even put aside any cyclical concern . move down to the portfolio level these threat emphasise the importance of the environmental and social lense within esg analysis . these need to be primarily consider at an individual stock or industry level but there be some general guideline . scrutiny of corporate be rise sharply management need to be aware of the esg risk face business the most important be the existence of price power . this be a key characteristic for the compounder in portfolio but be particularly important where company cost basis may experience shock be due to tariff high labour cost or more expensive energy . the ability to pass these input cost on to customer be crucial for preserve margin and thus profitability . amongst the other factor to look for would point to the advantage of relatively short and simple supply chain in a world where globalisation be under threat and the need to avoid dependence on carbon intensive process . more broadly in a world where scrutiny of corporate by both government and consumer be rise sharply management need to be aware of the environmental and social risk face business and proactive in deal with . there be clearly no room for complacency in this emerge political environment . however view be that investment process focusse on compounder with full esg integration deliver a portfolio of company that be relatively well place to deal with these risk be due to pricing power carbon lightness or the quality of management . risk considerations there be no assurance that a portfolio will achieve investment objective . portfolio be subject to market risk which be the possibility that the market value of security own by the portfolio will decline . accordingly can lose money invest in this strategy . please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risk . change in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographic and consumer preference government regulation and economic condition may adversely affect global franchise company and may negatively impact the strategy to a great extent than if the strategy s asset be invest in a wide variety of company . in general equity security value also fluctuate in response to activity specific to a company . investment in foreign market entail special risk such as currency political economic and market risk . stock of small capitalization company carry special risk such as limited product line market and financial resource and great market volatility than security of large more established company . the risk of invest in emerge market country be great than risk associate with investment in foreign develop market . non diversified portfolio often invest in a more limited number of issuer . as such change in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause great volatility . option writing strategy . writing call option involve the risk that the portfolio may be require to sell the underlie security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlie security or instrument at the time the option be exercise . as the writer of a call option the portfolio forgo during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increase in the market value of the underlie security or instrument cover the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retain the risk of loss should the price of the underlie security or instrument decline . additionally the portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect against decline in the value of the market . there be special risk associate with uncovered option writing which expose the portfolio to potentially significant loss .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  With U.S. equities near record highs investors may be seeking ways to position their portfolios for what lies ahead. It could be an opportune time to consider the inherently risk mitigating characteristics of long short equity strategies. As the name suggests long short equity strategies invest both long and short in publicly traded equities and equity related instruments. Compared to their long only counterparts long short strategies are designed to have lower sensitivity to equity market movements as measured by beta volatility and drawdowns. When included as part of a broadly diversified portfolio such strategies have the potential to 1 generate profits from their long and short positions and 2 provide an element of protection or hedge when markets decline because gains on short positions will dampen losses on long positions. What is shorting Short selling involves borrowing shares and selling them at a certain price on the assumption that the price will decline allowing the seller to buy shares back at a lower price and return them to the seller. Short selling is only profitable when share prices decline and may be exposed to steep losses if share prices rise. A Broad Category With A Strategy For Every Risk Appetite A range of strategies fall under the general category of long short equity Display 1 . In our view the most compelling strategy in today s market environment would be a low net or zero net strategy otherwise known as market neutral. Compared to other long short equity strategies market neutral strategies tend to exhibit low or zero beta lower market risk lower market volatility and seek to generate returns through stock selection. These strategies are not designed to shoot the lights out but they have the potential to provide steady gains even in down markets. DISPLAY 1 Characteristics of Long Short Equity Strategies Long Short Strategies Are Also Actively Managed In addition to the potentially risk mitigating benefits of including short positions long short strategies typically have flexibility to adjust their risk profiles in response to changing market conditions. They are not required to maintain static exposures nor are they tethered to a benchmark. Managers of market neutral strategies can take a variety of steps to reduce risk and protect capital specifically Reduce overall portfolio gross exposure by selling longs and covering shorts at the same time so that the portfolio has less capital at risk Reduce position sizes to reduce volatility Incorporate portfolio protection in the form of index hedges futures or options Long Short Strategies Have Held Their Own In Prior Market Downturns During the bear markets of 2000 2002 and 2007 2008 and the down markets of mid 2011 and late 2018 long short equity strategies broadly as measured by the HFRI Equity Hedge Total Index and market neutral strategies more specifically as measured by the HFRI Equity Market Neutral Index achieved their goal of mitigating downside risk relative to the broad markets across a variety of metrics Display 2 . DISPLAY 2 Long Short Equity Performance During Downturns Source Total return data from Bloomberg as of August 26 2019 Source Total return data from Bloomberg as of August 26 2019 Source Bloomberg as of August 26 2019 Among long short equity strategies market neutral strategies have proven particularly adept at managing downside risk over time while allowing investors to participate in up markets as well Displays 3 and 4 . Of course past performance is no guarantee of future results. Four main risks will always face long short equity investors MARKET RISK the risk of loss due to the impact of general market movements. IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK the risk of loss due to company specific factors that are generally not correlated with the broad market movement. SHORT SALE RISK the risk than an investment sold short generates significant losses because the stock price appreciates. LEVERAGE RISK the risk of loss due to unexpected interaction between longs and shorts or an improperly hedged portfolio.

      "Doc - Orig:  Amid concerns about potentially unsteady and down markets we believe two of the strategies employed by global macro managers are particularly worthy of consideration today long volatility and tail risk. What is Global Macro Global macro is an investment style that is very diverse Managers have the flexibility to take long or short positions in any global market using any liquid financial instrument. These strategies can be highly opportunistic and have the potential to generate strong risk adjusted returns in challenging markets. Designed to Behave Differently Historical spikes in market volatility and major inflection points in central bank policy measures have shown us that correlations among asset classes are not stable. Indeed during severe market dislocations diversification benefits across asset classes can quickly evaporate as correlations spike. Historically global macro has bucked this trend. For example as illustrated in Display 1 correlations between global macro as proxied by HFRI Macro Total Index and U.S. equities actually decreased during the technology bubble and the credit crisis. Looking across asset classes more broadly global macro has historically exhibited relatively low correlation to bond markets as well as to other hedge fund strategies particularly in crisis periods Display 2 .

DISPLAY 2 Global Macro Has Exhibited Low Correlation to Other Strategies Source Hedge Fund Research Inc. for HFRI indexes Bloomberg for all other indexes. Provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Performance in Challenging Markets On an absolute return basis global macro has tended to hold up well during market crises Display 3 as such market conditions often give rise to attractive trading opportunities on which global macro managers can potentially capitalize. DISPLAY 3 Global Macro Performance During Crisis Periods Source Hedge Fund Research Inc. for HFRI global indexes Bloomberg for all other global indexes. Provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Indeed certain global macro strategies are designed with the aim of outperforming in precisely these sorts of environments Display 4 . Among the most notable of these are dedicated long volatility and tail risk strategies. DISPLAY 4 Illustrative Market Return Distribution Provided for illustrative purposes only. A Closer Look at Long Volatility Strategies A closer look at the historical performance of long volatility and tail risk strategies reveals dramatic downside risk mitigating characteristics Display 5 . DISPLAY 5 Historical Down Capture Statistics Provided for illustrative purposes only. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Long volatility strategies have a high degree of exposure to or a long bias to the level of market volatility. They tend to exhibit positive correlation to market volatility and negative correlation to equities over most time horizons. In other words they are designed to seek to deliver positive returns during periods of market turbulence. Historically they have delivered. Tail risk strategies comprise a subset of the long volatility universe that exhibits a high degree of convexity a level of payout that is outsized in comparison to the change in an underlying variable to large increases in market volatility or declines in equity prices. They are characterized by opportunistic and hedging positions that are intended to deliver positive returns during dramatic market declines. As shown in Display 5 they too have historically proven successful over time. The Cost Of course no investment strategy is without risk or cost. Long volatility strategies tend to be structured with options and other insurance like products. Options are highly liquid derivative instruments that allow investors to target very specific exposures for instance a specific commodity currency or index but the cost of holding them in benign markets is not insignificant Display 6 . DISPLAY 6 Return Payoff Histogram Provided for illustrative purposes only. Tail risk strategies tend to be less costly to carry. Benefiting from greater convexity profiles their potential payoffs can be considerably larger than long volatility exposures. However those payoffs would only occur during more extreme market conditions. While the potential benefits of these strategies are clear it is important to determine the appropriate size of an allocation. Investors will want to be sure that the peace of mind and potential payoff provided by these strategies make sense in the context of associated costs and the portfolio s overall target return and volatility level. Conclusion Over time global macro has demonstrated its ability to perform differently from other asset classes and to weather difficult market conditions making it in our opinion a valuable component of any well diversified portfolio.1 In addition we believe that long volatility strategies including tail risk strategies have the potential to reduce drawdowns in investor portfolios during volatility shocks and market downturns by seeking to generate positive returns amidst market dislocations. 1 Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. \n"

      "Doc - Orig:  The good news about equities is that there are only two ways to lose money falling earnings or falling multiples. A year ago it was the multiples that worried us most. After the markets bull run in 2017 the MSCI World Index passed 17x the next 12 months NTM earnings 1 implying that markets were pricing in the improbable upside scenario of synchronized growth everywhere and threatening considerable downside if things did not go quite according to plan. By contrast 2019 starts with the MSCI World Index on 13.4x forward consensus estimates 14% lower than the 20 year average price earnings P E ratio of 15.5x and 20% below a year ago.2 As a result our primary fears have moved from multiples to earnings. Our primary fears have moved from multiples to earnings Our generic fear about forward earnings estimates remain the fact that they are guesses about lies. The guesses are because the sell side is persistently over optimistic by an average of 8% one year forward slightly higher than the 7% earnings growth expected for the MSCI World Index in 2019.3 The lies are down to the gaping gap between the adjusted earnings used to power consensus numbers and management pay and the actual IFRS GAAP4 number at the bottom of the profit and loss statement. Over the last three years $600 billion has disappeared between the adjusted and actual earnings totals in the U.S. alone overstating earnings there by an average of 21%.5 Our more specific anxiety is fed by the fact that it is only on the leveraged earnings metric that markets look cheap. Looking at forward enterprise value EV EBITDA6 rather than P E the discount to the historic average disappears and the market is on a slightly higher multiple 9.2x versus 9.0x than it was in 2003 when the P E ratio was at a lofty 17.6x.7 Lower corporate taxes have helped but so has the sharp increase in leverage of which we discuss further later in the piece. Looking at EV sales the MSCI World Index is 1.8x still 16% above its 20 year average.8 The combination of an expensive market on sales with a cheap market on earnings reflects the really high profitability at present particularly in the U.S. where all the drivers look fairly maxed out in favour of profits at present be it fat margins low tax rates high leverage or low interest rates. We have no greater insight than anyone else on whether the expected earnings growth for 2019 will be delivered or even exceeded but we do have opinions as usual on the key variables to watch. The current China slowdown is an earnings risk particularly for cyclical companies and the extent and success of the gathering reflation is crucial. Even if the reflation does happen and is successful earnings could be soft in the first part of the year until it takes effect. As mentioned above U.S. margins are very high and while elements of this look structural given the emergence of lucrative platform businesses and the way the country s political system has systematically advantaged capital against labour and consumers over the last four decades tight labour markets and tariff impacts may cause margin issues for those without pricing power. Leaving aside the tail risks such as a full trade war utter paralysis of the U.S. government Mid East conflict or a collapse of the euro one thing that would definitely cause a margin squeeze would be a significant slowdown in the U.S. or a further slowdown in Europe. The U.S. recovery is now very long in the tooth and while recoveries do not just die of old age the change at the U.S. Federal Reserve the Fed may be an extra cause for concern. It is still early days but Jay Powell seems more interested in the state of the real economy than the exact level of the equity markets or the fate of anyone outside the U.S. who chooses to hitch their currencies to the U.S. dollar i.e. emerging markets. He may therefore continue to tighten via a combination of interest rates and unwinding quantitative easing until he sees weakness in the U.S. economy. He will back off at that point but this may be too late for markets. 2018 has ended with the combined balance sheets of the four major central banks the Fed the People s Bank of China the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan finally shrinking after the massive build post the Global Financial Crisis GFC . This means that the world is now in a liquidity squeeze combining depending on the geographic bloc shrinking central bank balance sheets and tightening interest rates. It is precisely the opposite combination that drove up asset prices and consequent levering up since the nadir of 2009. DISPLAY 1 Central Banks Balance Sheet vs. MSCI World Total Return Index Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management FactSet MSCI. Our concern is that the combination of potentially falling earnings and a liquidity squeeze could be a truly toxic one for asset prices. We mentioned that we were unclear whether earnings estimates would be met this year but we are clear that the world is an asymmetric place with earnings downsides in bad times far higher than the upsides in good times. This is often forgotten as is the fact that the asymmetry is magnified by leverage and there is more leverage than ever particularly in the U.S. corporate debt market. Corporate America as a whole is not inexpert at levering itself up at the wrong time most spectacularly just before the GFC last time round. Given the scale of corporate leverage now and more particularly the component of high yield or near high yield or as we prefer to call it given that the interest rates are not that high junk or near junk Corporate America has to be right that earnings will hold up. DISPLAY 2 Components of U.S. Corporate Debt Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management FactSet ICE BofAML Indexes. We worry in particular about the outlook for near junk i.e. BBB. This has been at the epicentre of the buildup of corporate debt ballooning from $0.7 trillion in October 2008 to the current c. $3 trillion.9 Moreover the component of near junk BBB and actual junk BB B and CCC and below has increased from 46% of the U.S. corporate bond market in October 2008 to 58% currently 10 so the quality of the overall corporate bond market has clearly deteriorated. If U.S. earnings do fall significantly then there could be significant downgrades from BBB to junk. We do not think the currently quiescent so called high yield market is pricing in such an outcome. In that event the equity market is sure to hear about it big problems in the credit market invariably mean big problems in the equity market especially as they would have a common cause falling earnings and too much debt. A combination of recurring revenue and pricing power should protect revenues and margins in a downturn preserving earnings In this uncertain and acutely asymmetric world we would continue to advocate owning compounders. The combination of recurring revenue and pricing power should protect revenues and margins respectively in a downturn preserving earnings. They are also likely to be insulated from any financial distress if the corporate bond markets have a seizure given the lower operational and financial leverage. The soft markets of the fourth quarter have deflated the portfolio s multiples a little with the estimated 2019 free cash flow yield now over 5% reducing the absolute downside risk.11 \n",

be on a slightly high multiple 9.2x versus 9.0x than be in 2003 when the p e ratio be at a lofty 17.6x.7 low corporate taxis have help but so have the sharp increase in leverage of which discuss further later in the piece . look at ev sale the msci world index be 1.8x still 16 % above 20 year average.8 the combination of an expensive market on sale with a cheap market on earning reflect the really high profitability at present particularly in the u.s. where all the driver look fairly maxe out in favour of profit at present be fat margin low tax rate high leverage or low interest rate . have no great insight than anyone else on whether the expect earning growth for 2019 will be deliver or even exceed but do have opinion as usual on the key variable to watch . the current china slowdown be an earning risk particularly for cyclical company and the extent and success of the gather reflation be crucial . even if the reflation do happen and be successful earning could be soft in the first part of the year until take effect . as mention above u.s. margin be very high and while element of this look structural give the emergence of lucrative platform business and the way the country s political system have systematically advantage capital against labour and consumer over the last four decade tight labour market and tariff impact may cause margin issue for those without price power . leave aside the tail risk such as a full trade war utter paralysis of the u.s. government mid east conflict or a collapse of the euro one thing that would definitely cause a margin squeeze would be a significant slowdown in the u.s. or a further slowdown in europe . the u.s. recovery be now very long in the tooth and while recovery do not just die of old age the change at the u.s. federal reserve the fed may be an extra cause for concern . be still early day but jay powell seem more interested in the state of the real economy than the exact level of the equity market or the fate of anyone outside the u.s. who choose to hitch currency to the u.s. dollar i.e. emerge market . may therefore continue to tighten via a combination of interest rate and unwind quantitative easing until see weakness in the u.s. economy . will back off at that point but this may be too late for market . 2018 have end with the combined balance sheet of the four major central bank the fed the people s bank of china the european central bank and the bank of japan finally shrink after the massive build post the global financial crisis gfc . this mean that the world be now in a liquidity squeeze combine depend on the geographic bloc shrink central bank balance sheet and tighten interest rate . be precisely the opposite combination that drive up asset price and consequent lever up since the nadir of 2009 . display 1 central banks balance sheet vs. msci world total return index source morgan stanley investment management factset msci . concern be that the combination of potentially fall earning and a liquidity squeeze could be a truly toxic one for asset price . mention that be unclear whether earning estimate would be meet this year but be clear that the world be an asymmetric place with earning downside in bad time far high than the upside in good time . this be often forget as be the fact that the asymmetry be magnify by leverage and there be more leverage than ever particularly in the u.s. corporate debt market . corporate america as a whole be not inexpert at lever up at the wrong time most spectacularly just before the gfc last time round . give the scale of corporate leverage now and more particularly the component of high yield or near high yield or as prefer to call give that the interest rate be not that high junk or near junk corporate america have to be right that earning will hold up . display 2 components of u.s. corporate debt source morgan stanley investment management factset ice bofaml indexes . worry in particular about the outlook for near junk i.e. bbb . this have be at the epicentre of the buildup of corporate debt ballooning from $ 0.7 trillion in october 2008 to the current c. $ 3 trillion.9 moreover the component of near junk bbb and actual junk bb b and ccc and below have increase from 46 % of the u.s. corporate bond market in october 2008 to 58 % currently 10 so the quality of the overall corporate bond market have clearly deteriorate . if u.s. earning do fall significantly then there could be significant downgrade from bbb to junk . do not think the currently quiescent so call high yield market be price in such an outcome . in that event the equity market be sure to hear about big problem in the credit market invariably mean big problem in the equity market especially as would have a common cause fall earning and too much debt . a combination of recur revenue and pricing power should protect revenue and margin in a downturn preserve earning in this uncertain and acutely asymmetric world would continue to advocate own compounder . the combination of recur revenue and pricing power should protect revenue and margin respectively in a downturn preserve earning . be also likely to be insulate from any financial distress if the corporate bond market have a seizure give the lower operational and financial leverage . the soft market of the fourth quarter have deflate the portfolio s multiple a little with the estimate 2019 free cash flow yield now over 5 % reduce the absolute downside risk.11\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The market ripped upwards in January with the MSCI World Index rising nearly 8% and in fairness there was definitely some good news flow behind the recovery. Arguably the three main wolves stalking the market in the fourth quarter were the Trade Wars China and the U.S. Federal Reserve the Fed and all three areas saw some reasons for cheer in the month. The mood music on the U.S. China trade negotiations seemed to improve and China started pressing its stimulus buttons in earnest in a bid to revive growth. Most dramatically Jerome Powell played the part of the Woodcutter rescuing Little Red Riding Hood from the wolves as the Fed shocked the market even experienced Fed watchers with its dovish tone in January despite a spectacular U.S. jobs report that saw over 300 000 jobs added.1 The three main wolves stalking the market were the Trade Wars China and the U.S. Federal Reserve and all three areas saw some reasons for cheer While recognising the improvements we still remain cautious on all three areas and suggest that the wolves are not yet slain and Little Red Riding Hood is not yet out of the woods. The last two years have taught us that there is nothing predictable about the progress of U.S. trade policy and there is some way to go to make enough progress to defuse the bomb of the extra tariffs on China due to come in on March 1. We would also argue that the main longer term trade threat is around the technology sector rather than tariffs on industrial or agricultural goods. A deal on tariffs is distinctly possible but a peace treaty in the technology area is much tougher. Technology is increasingly being seen across the U.S. political spectrum as the battleground between the incumbent U.S. and the challenger China. The arrest of the Huawei CFO in Canada is one sign of this increased tension which could end with global technology value chains being split into two separate systems with dramatic implications for the technology hardware sector. Equally the success of the China stimulus is not a given. While the Chinese government has always pulled off its reflations in the past and dragged the world economy with it most notably after the Global Financial Crisis the increasing size complexity and indebtedness of the Chinese economy make it more difficult every time. In addition the domestic and consumption focus of this year s effort may mean that less benefit is felt overseas. Finally while the dovish noises from the Fed are naturally a positive for asset markets as the threat of automatic tightening has faded the fact is that the Fed may be forced to tighten significantly as the labour market tightens. Unemployment is now down to 4% and wage growth is creeping up particularly amongst the lower paid.2 Our caution about the January surge and Little Red Riding Hood s safety is not just around the three fears or wolves mentioned above. A further wolf is the fact that the world economy is in a synchronised slowdown. The sugar rush of the U.S. tax cuts is wearing off Europe is seeing minimal growth with the forward looking PMIs Purchasing Managers Indexes at their lowest since July 2013 3 and China has yet to see the benefits of the move to stimulus. The worry is the effect that this existing slowdown will have on corporate earnings. It is aggravated by the margin pressures being felt in the U.S. where first quarter earnings are expected to be down year on year as cost pressures bite. The healthy earnings growth expected for this year with MSCI World Index earnings up 6% in 2019 and the U.S. growing earnings at over 10% by the fourth quarter may well not be delivered. Our worry is the effect of synchronized slowdown on corporate earnings Given that earnings estimates drifted down in January particularly in the U.S. the January market rise was entirely due to rising multiples. The MSCI World Index went from 13.4x next 12 months earnings to 14.5x. This is not particularly high by historical standards providing the earnings are actually delivered which is far from certain given the slowing world economy. Markets are certainly not pricing in anything worse than a mild slowdown nor are highly levered corporate balance sheets prepared for anything more severe. Given our anxiety about the outlook for earnings we would continue to advocate owning compounders. The combination of recurring revenue and pricing power should protect revenues and margins respectively preserving their profits. They are also likely to be relatively immune from any financial distress if the corporate bond markets have a seizure. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed policy continues to shift from accommodative to neutral we expect volatility in both rates and credit markets to remain high. Entering 2019 we maintain a positive fundamental outlook on most credit oriented securitized assets as real estate and consumer credit conditions remain constructive. However we have concerns that mark to market volatility could increase. We continue to have a more cautious view on agency mortgage backed securities MBS due to supply demand headwinds from the Fed winding down its $1.7 trillion MBS holdings and from potential reductions in bank holdings of agency MBS. We believe the securitized world is on track to begin 2019 offering higher yields than at the start of 2018 this is largely a function of higher interest rates and wider spreads across many sectors. Given our view of a more range bound interest rate environment in 2019 we expect the cashflow yields of securitized assets to dominate returns and we believe these yields offer compelling risk adjusted opportunities. Display 1 Outlook Summary Interest Rates and Fiscal Policy In the U.S. rising interest rates and tightening Fed policy were the dominant themes for 2018. For 2019 we expect between two and four 25 basis point rate hikes by the Fed in addition to another interest rate hike in December 2018. Depending on economic conditions we project terminal Fed Funds rates between 3% and 3.5% and continued curve flattening with 10 year U.S. Treasury rates also ranging between 3% and 3.5%. We expect unemployment to remain low and wages to continue to rise while broader gross domestic product GDP growth should taper due to global headwinds and the impact from higher rates. This forecast should bode well for credit related securitized assets as it implies healthy U.S. household and consumer credit conditions while also keeping residential and commercial mortgage rates constrained and relatively low by historical standards. We maintained a relatively short duration positioning in 2018 due to a concern of rising rates. Although our concern about the impact from higher rates has largely been realized we continue to maintain a shorter duration positioning due to the flatness of the curve which we believe provides minimal compensation for taking on longer duration risks. In Europe and the U.K. we expect accommodative central bank policies to continue due to modest economic growth and uncertainty surrounding both Brexit and Italy. Although the European Central Bank ECB has announced the end of its asset backed securities ABS purchase program given their relatively low level of ABS purchases we do not expect this change to have a material impact on European ABS valuations. Low interest rates have had a positive effect on home prices consumer credit and general economic health across most of Europe and we do not foresee these conditions to deteriorate any time soon. We expect modestly positive growth to continue within most of the eurozone although we believe the U.K. could experience a modest recession due to Brexit impacts. Agency MBS 2018 was a difficult year for U.S. agency MBS plagued by rising interest rates extended durations widened spreads increased volatility and supply demand headwinds resulting from the decline in Fed MBS purchases. Agency MBS one of the most interest rate sensitive sectors within securitized markets comprises the vast majority of the securitized world. Since these securities are largely characterized by fixed rate mortgages mortgage prepayment speeds play a crucial role in determining the duration of these securities. As interest rates increased in 2018 the large majority of the mortgage market became out of the money from a rate based refinance perspective and mortgage prepayment speeds slowed significantly. Considering the rough year that agency MBS had in 2018 we believe that the majority of the damage from higher interest rates and rising volatility has now been realized for the sector as interest rates are 70 to 100 basis points higher MBS durations are now more than a year longer interest rate volatility and mortgage option costs have increased and nominal spreads to U.S. Treasuries have widened 20 to 30 basis points. 1 However supply pressure from decreasing Fed purchases will continue into 2019 and possibly accelerate. The Fed began 2018 buying roughly $20 billion agency MBS per month and ended the year essentially making no new purchases. 2 The Fed s agency MBS holdings fell by more than $100 billion over the course of 2018 from $1.77 trillion to $1.67 trillion and we expect the portfolio to shrink to a greater degree in 2019. 3 Despite our expectation for agency MBS spreads to widen further in 2019 as a function of weaker demand we still expect agency MBS to outperform U.S. Treasuries with the additional carry of agency MBS outweighing the impact from widening spreads. Within agency MBS we continue to favor higher coupon MBS which offer greater duration adjusted carry and have the potential to benefit from either a stable interest rate environment or a continued rising rate environment. U.S. Housing Market Fundamentals and Non Agency RMBS In 2018 U.S. home prices rose roughly 5% to 6% for the seventh consecutive year but the impact of rising home prices in conjunction with rising interest rates has begun to negatively impact home affordability. 4 Going forward we project U.S. home price appreciation to closely mirror U.S. economic growth and to be constrained by affordability. Despite increasingly more challenging affordability housing demand is still healthy due to a robust economy and a housing supply that is relatively low by historical standards. This favorable supply demand dynamic leads us to project that U.S. home prices will rise between 3% to 4% in 2019. Non agency residential mortgage backed securities RMBS should continue to perform well in 2019 although to a lesser degree than in recent years. Mortgage market conditions remain healthy with declining mortgage delinquency and default rates reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy and upward trajectory of home prices. Spreads on non agency RMBS have tightened significantly over the past several years and material further spread tightening seems unlikely. We believe that non agency RMBS still offers reasonably compelling risk adjusted carry compared to other sectors and performance in 2019 should largely be a function of cashflow based returns with little expectation of price appreciation. Over the past few years we have reduced our non agency RMBS holdings from our biggest overweight to a moderate overweight but we still remain positive on the sector. European RMBS Driven by a low mortgage rate environment and improving economic conditions we believe that home price appreciation across most of Europe will continue into 2019. We particularly favor RMBS in areas which we believe to have the greatest potential for home price appreciation especiallly Spain Portugal Ireland and Greece. We also like RMBS in the Netherlands Germany and selectively in the U.K. Although we expect that home prices will soften in the U.K. we do not expect a material decline largely due to limited housing supply and low mortgage interest rates. Within U.K. RMBS we have a strong bias towards very seasoned loans. These loans have the advantage of significant embedded home price appreciation and are held by borrowers who have proven payment histories. Finally we also favor countries with well established mortgage lending laws which facilitate reasonably swift repossession of properties in the event of defaults. U.S. Commercial Real Estate CMBS U.S. commercial real estate experienced a period of significant growth post crisis however prices have stabilized over the past two years and we expect prices to remain relatively flat in 2019. Commercial real estate conditions remain positive with high occupancy levels rising rental rates and a healthy U.S. economy but higher interest rates could provide a headwind in 2019. The commercial real estate market is a highly idiosyncratic sector as credit quality can vary significantly between different asset classes and specific properties. We are generally constructive on the housing sector of commercial real estate office buildings and distribution centers. We continue to have concerns about retail shopping centers as the Amazon effect continues to impact how consumers shop and the viability of many brick and mortar shopping stores. We are also cautious regarding hotel valuations given the volatile nature of their earnings and valuations. European Commercial Real Estate CMBS We expect to see diverging trends in European commercial real estate markets with many European cities becoming beneficiaries of Brexit related locations while London will likely suffer from over building and weakened demand for office space. We have largely avoided U.K. commercial real estate exposure and have a cautious outlook for U.K. commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS in 2019. Although supply of European CMBS remains limited given the dearth of securitizations over the past few years and sourcing opportunities can be challenging we remain generally positive on European commercial real estate. Consumer Credit and ABS Consumer credit continues to improve in the U.S. with low unemployment rising wages increased savings rates and more conservative consumer debt levels. Credit card debt auto loans and consumer loans have performed well and we believe this positive dynamic will continue in 2019. Consumer ABS was one of the few sectors to experience spread tightening in 2018 causing relative value for consumer ABS to appear slightly less compelling than it was a year ago but we remain positive from a fundamental credit perspective. We favor the relatively short duration nature of consumer ABS which limits risk exposure to a potential recessionary environment in 2020 or 2021. European ABS spreads remain relatively tight and offer less attractive relative value. Fundamental credit conditions appear generally positive but vary by country based on lending laws and local economic conditions. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Over the last 50 years the leading staples companies have prospered in an analogue world. This was evident from their dominant market shares compounding sales growth and sustainably high returns on operating capital. But the digital age has presented two key challenges to this prosperity e commerce and new marketing platforms including social media search. It is fair to suggest that the consumer staples industry has been slow to adapt. Growth rates have slowed from mid single digit rates to low single digit. There has been talk of the end of big brands. However we see evidence that the leading consumer staples companies are starting to crack the digital code. A combination of scale and skill is allowing such leading brands to thrive and sales growth is picking up again. The digital age has presented two key challenges to consumer staples prosperity e commerce and social media Let s start with e commerce in China where a domestic e commerce company is at the technological and innovative cutting edge providing an online ecosystem with arguably the world s best digital brand building platform. Unlike elsewhere in the world brands have their own virtual stores featuring services such as loyalty programs and livestreaming. These virtual stores are segmented by the platform provider for example The Luxury Pavilion which gives prestige beauty brands their own section. This avoids these brands being crowded out by mass market offerings or being placed next to household cleaner products. Data on consumer habits is shared with the branded companies by the platform provider helping to accelerate product innovation. The platform dramatically expands the reach of a brand beyond Tier 1 2 all the way down to Tier 4 5 cities adding a potential 600 million consumers.1 Leading staples companies in China including those from Europe and the United States are seeing the payoff from their digital investment evident in a sharp acceleration in Chinese sales. For instance a large French beauty company we own in the portfolio posted 26% year on year growth in Asia Pacific in 2018 up from 11% in 2017 and less than 5% in 2015 and 2016.1 Outside China a well known American e commerce site dominates the digital retail space but in sharp contrast to its Chinese counterpart it doesn t share its consumer data focuses on price rather than brand building and uses its own label as a direct competitor. This drives the consensual view that the company is out to destroy brands whereas in reality most of its own brands have failed against the leading consumer staples companies which have learned how to compete on the platform effectively. Such companies make sure they are at the top of key word searches crucial now that 55% of all product searches in the U.S. occur directly on this platform2 and work to gain top customer rankings and reviews for their products. These companies also benefit from there being more than one e commerce operator in the U.S. traditional retailers have invested heavily in their own e commerce offerings. In 2018 the number one traditional retailer grew e commerce sales by 40% while the top discount retailer grew its sales by 36%.3 This broader digital opportunity enabled the leading consumer staples companies to grow their own global and U.S. e commerce sales by approximately 40% in the same period 4 well ahead of both the leading U.S. e commerce platform and the industry growth rate. The digital opportunities in the U.S. enabled leading consumer staples companies to grow e commerce sales by approximately 40% in 2018 Today e commerce generates between 5 10% of the leading consumer staples companies sales versus 1 2% five years ago.4 Importantly for consumer staples companies e commerce has similar operating margins to selling in brick and mortar stores and e retailers make more profit selling large rather than small brands. On the digital marketing front Silicon Valley s key advertising platforms in the guise of search engines and social media sites have effectively acted as a tax on consumer staples companies. Over the last five years consumer staples executives have reallocated 30% to 50% of marketing budgets4 from traditional media to digital marketing on the promise of higher returns on investment and have instead been rewarded with slowing sales growth rates. Consumer staples companies now seem to recognise that they need to retrain and transform their marketing departments it is not as simple as just throwing money at digital marketing. Historically a company would brief an advertising agency up to a year in advance to come up with the creative content for a global advertising campaign as well as the tactical execution of said campaign such as the best time of day to show the newly created advert. Today consumer staples marketing teams have social listening teams that pick up on the latest trends among influencers . They have in house creative teams to produce a constant stream of content for social media sites. Specialist teams mine data and monitor in real time the performance of digital spend. For example does targeting a deodorant campaign at men aged 20 30 and who play sport produce a better hit rate than targeting men aged 20 30 who smoke As the leading consumer staples companies gain greater know how from mastering the basics clean data buying the right key words speeding up loading time to their websites to producing high quality digital content two seconds rather than six seconds for an advert we believe the current digital marketing platform tax will diminish. If you want to make digital work you have to retool and retrain So as investors how do we gauge who is doing a good job We have also had to go back to school. In the last few years a host of consumer staples companies cut their advertising and promotion A P costs as a percentage of sales claiming digital spend had a higher return on investment. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. If you want to make digital work you need to retool retrain. This means hiring hundreds or thousands of digital experts. The cost of this investment sits in the selling general and administrative SG A line of the profit and loss account rather than the A P line. Once an organisation has retooled and hired the digital experts these experts then start asking for more money to spend on digital content so A P spend goes back up. If successful sales growth then reaccelerates and brings down SG A costs as a percentage of sales. One of the companies in our portfolio a global leader in beauty brands is at the forefront of this digital evolution and we believe provides a useful guide to measure where on the journey other consumer staples companies are. The consultant Gartner L2 ranks 1 872 brands on their expertise across the digital landscape. In 2018 57 of these brands earned the title Genius or best in class. The beauty holding in question owned the greatest number of Genius brands seven as well as reporting sales growth of 7% its fastest growth in over 10 years and close to 1.5x the beauty market as a whole s growth.5 Consumer staples that crack the digital code can reinforce moats compound sales growth and sustain high returns on operating capital We believe consumer staples companies that crack the digital code can reinforce their moats continue to compound their sales growth and sustain a high return on operating capital for years to come. Big brands in the new digital world can thrive if they combine scale and skill. As investors when assessing a company s attributes in addition to being well invested decentralised and entrepreneurial we want to see digital expertise. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Private equity investing has evolved beyond the days of buy low and sell high. Now the focus is on transforming portfolio companies into category leading platforms. Private equity investment managers have typically sought to generate returns without the short term uncertainties and market cycles that propel public markets. Ideally the ability to identify promising companies provide guidance to execute strategic plans and improve operations gives private equity investors a greater degree of control over investment outcomes. It s not about stock watching. It s about investing in promising businesses that require capital for transformation says Aaron Sack head of Morgan Stanley Capital Partners. Every year thousands of middle market businesses in the U.S. are seeking investors many growing well in excess of GDP. However the private equity landscape is changing. Amid high valuations and increasing competition in the middle market arena investment managers need to go beyond the traditional private equity playbook of buying low and selling high or making minor operational changes that amount to a fresh coat of paint. Instead Sack says the newest iteration of private equity means seeking to improve company quality by combining operational precision with strategic vision then building value through acquisition. Taking Operations into the Weeds There was a time when private equity firms plied their trade buying companies at a discount and flipping them for a profit. That approach has evolved considerably over the past decade as more firms have embraced an increasingly hands on approach the operating model though to varying degrees. Typically the old approach meant appointing industry experts to the board to provide big picture advice. However it came with limitations particularly for small and midsized companies. Founders and management teams at middle market companies are focused on running the day to day business says Sack They often don t have the bandwidth to execute a new strategy let alone identify possible acquisitions or strategic partners along the way. As such the next generation of private equity must drive operational change at many levels and from many angles. One method of accomplishing this change which is becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry and which Morgan Stanley Capital Partners helped pioneer is by including operating partners with industry specific expertise to actively advise the senior team. These professionals take the lead on mapping out and giving advice that is critical to the execution of strategic plans for portfolio companies in their respective areas. At the earliest stages of each investment we work with management to guide the development of a value creation plan focused on the handful of initiatives we believe will be most impactful says Sack. We ensure we re aligned on the Key Performance Indicators KPIs for each he adds and then meticulously track these to assess progress toward specific goals. Yet a great strategy does little good if it s diluted or derailed by poor execution. Recognizing this Morgan Stanley Capital Partners is taking the operational model to the company level with team members who work alongside company management and leverage their business experience to advise on implementing the highly bespoke strategic plans. These professionals whom we call accelerators play a critical role in guiding a value creation plan through and just as importantly identifying ways to potentially improve it or modify it to reflect changes challenges or opportunities that come up along the way and sharing those with senior management says Sack. We think our accelerator program is unique in the way that it reinforces the operational vision led by management and our operating partners but empowers management to accomplish these objectives with on the ground resources not previously available to them. Whereas traditional private equity firms often look to buy out owners and replace top management this model strives to be collaborative incentivizing founders and key employees to work toward a common goal. Unlocking Untapped Potential Sack believes this operating model is particularly powerful when applied to middle market companies which represent a large diverse and undercapitalized segment. The middle market universe is wide ranging and can offer greater opportunities to add value Sack says. And in many cases these companies are seeking institutional capital for the first time. While these companies tend to have proven track records in their respective industries they can offer a good deal of upside. Even small enhancements to their operations and strategy can profoundly improve their profitability and growth. There are so many opportunities to transform businesses of this size he adds and you can work to do this independent of what s happening in the broader economy. Turning Success into a Platform There are many ways for private equity teams to potentially achieve strong results with individual stand alone acquisitions. Yet arguably the real potential for generating alpha comes from building on the success of one company to create a platform for add on deals. When we pursue opportunities to add to these thriving businesses each acquisition brings the potential to further reduce costs and drive new revenue streams says Sack. Having accelerators actively advising the company he adds is key for identifying vetting and integrating acquisitions. Whatever the industry a platform approach opens doors to acquire smaller firms potentially at attractive valuations and apply a cohesive strategy that drives earnings growth and lowers average acquisition costs. Success in private equity isn t just about finding the right companies refining operations or finding accretive acquisitions it s about bringing together all of those components so that whole is greater than the sum of the parts says Sack. That is the real difference in creating value versus simply looking for it. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Factory automation has been around since the advent of the mechanized spinning wheel in the late 18th century Britain which began the Industrial Revolution. The first robots were introduced by the auto industry in the 1960s and since then auto manufacturers and their suppliers have been the largest commercial users of robots. In the last decade however advances in technology have enabled robots to address more needs across a greater number of industries. Historically their biggest issues have been high cost and lack of flexibility. Over the last 10 years three technological changes in robotics have increased their flexibility lowered their cost and expanded their addressable market. First suites of sensors originally developed for smartphones and video gaming have been adapted to robotics. The scale of these industries enabled them to invest in rapid advances and achieve lowered costs through mass production that the smaller robotics industry could never have achieved on its own. Second improved software is lowering the cost of integration programming and outfitting the robot to perform its task . Whereas before it may have taken an engineer or computer scientist a month to program a robot with the newest software a company can use less skilled labor to program the robot in one to two days. Third improved and lower cost grippers are increasing the number of applications that can be addressed with robots. Combined with sensors that provide feedback on the force required to manipulate an object properly a new generation of grippers have a higher level of dexterity than their predecessors and can perform a larger range of tasks. Taken together these three developments lower costs of deployment and expand the addressable market for robots away from just the manufacture of high volume products with little product variability. They are enabling new categories of robots that serve a wider set of end markets. Robots today are going through a period of rapid advancement. These improvements are allowing robots to expand beyond their historic market in the auto industry into industries like consumer electronics logistics and even services. In the coming years the number of tasks that will be automatable with robotics will likely only increase. We will stay abreast of these changes to determine the longer term impact of robotics on the investment opportunity set. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have fluctuated wildly over the last year bitcoin and blockchain the underlying technology that powers it have captured the popular imagination. Blockchain at its heart is a distributed ledger technology that employs cryptography to ensure the integrity of the data it stores. For all its hype blockchain is basically just a novel approach to database architecture where control of the data is distributed among all the parties using it. This architecture is enabled by cryptography and the use of tokens i.e. cryptocurrencies as incentives for participants to perform the work to ensure the data s integrity. What makes blockchain so disruptive is its shared ledger eliminates the need for intermediaries to establish trust and authenticate identity between two untrusted parties who want to transact. As a result blockchain has the potential to cut out the financial middleman. In particular cryptocurrencies are gaining traction as a form of payment for e commerce transactions where there is a high risk of fraud and or chargebacks. While blockchain technology can be adopted by existing financial institutions to facilitate transactions it has the potential to enable a new set of payment rails that circumvents the existing financial establishment. It is still unclear if bitcoin will become a lasting piece of the financial firmament or is just a passing fad. While it has the potential to become as ubiquitous as the internet over time there are nevertheless many issues to be addressed. As with the internet we will probably see a mixture of both blockchain native companies as well as companies adopting the technology to improve their existing business processes and to attack new market opportunities afforded by these new capabilities. We believe blockchain is a technology that will continue to garner increasing mindshare in the years ahead. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Machine learning is a way to train computer systems to generate useful insights from data sets and apply those insights to new situations. This has the potential to revolutionize many fields such as medical diagnoses and driving by excising human discretion and error from the process. Although iterations of this technology have been around since the 1950s in recent years the explosion of collected data combined with an increase in computing power has increased the abilities of this disruptive technology. Machine learning describes a process by which computer scientists feed large sets of curated data to a computer in order to train it to deal with new situations. The computer learns by discovering complex patterns and relationships between the inputs and outputs in the dataset on which it has been trained. The relationships discovered by the computer are then applied to new data allowing the computer to make useful predictions based on that new data. The opportunities here are immense this form of artificial intelligence has the potential to breed new industries and create efficiencies in existing ones. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Ken Michlitsch AIP Alternative Lending Group Portfolio Manager interviews Upstart CEO David Girouard about the increasingly important role machine learning plays in the consumer lending process. Background Machine learning has been embraced by many industries from online shopping to autonomous cars but finance has been a relatively slow adopter. With the rise of alternative lending over the last decade that has started to change to the benefit of consumer borrowers. With alternative lending online platforms use a marketplace model to bring together borrowers and lenders. These platforms think about all aspects of the underwriting process through a different lens than traditional lenders do. While traditional lenders focus on the FICO score a backward looking consumer credit risk assessment metric alternative lending platforms use a much broader set of data that can help predict a borrower s ability to repay a loan in the future based on educational background current employment city of residence and bank account details. For a young borrower with a credit history too short for a meaningful FICO score alternative lending platforms can mean access to credit not otherwise available and at rates more attractive than those offered by credit card companies. Underpinning this marketplace model is data access to lots of data and the ability to analyze it quickly. That s where machine learning comes in. Machine learning facilitates real time processing of huge volumes of data about loans and ever improving ever smarter models to make sense of it all. In short the success of alternative lending has been driven by the same boom in data that we ve seen disrupt industry after industry. What prompted your decision to launch Upstart The traditional lending model hasn t changed in many decades. Banks continue to use the same backward looking metrics and models that they ve used for years making credit available to the same types of borrowers at the same terms. That works well for some borrowers but not all. We realized the types of technologies we were building at Google could make a positive impact on how credit is accessed by more types of borrowers. The tools we were working on could provide a more predictive model that could understand who an applicant is his propensity to pay something back and his capacity to pay it back. In short we saw the opportunity to dramatically improve access to credit for people. Far more people in this country are judged as risky than actually are. What type of borrower stands to benefit from the alternative lending model Younger borrowers come to mind. We think of ideal candidates as future prime borrowers they don t have blemished credit but they don t have a lot of history either. They are transforming themselves from being net debtors often because of student loans or medical bills to being wealth creators. Machine learning helps us see the trajectory of their incomes. Can you compare and contrast alternative lending underwriting with traditional bank underwriting Traditional models tend to be FICO centric and rules based. For example a borrower must be above a certain FICO score and can t have had any bankruptcies within a certain number of years in order to qualify for a loan. The rate a bank assigns to a borrower who meets those criteria depends on the perceived credit worthiness assigned by their model. A borrower who falls short on any of these measures is simply denied credit. Traditional lenders have come to use a larger number of variables relying on linear regressions to inform their views on which variables matter most but their models have remained fairly static over time. Alternative lenders analyze thousands of variables including borrower bank account transactions monthly repayments prepayments delinquencies and their models look for patterns in the way those variables interact. Much more quickly than a human being ever could machine learning enables models to learn from data as soon as it s introduced becoming better and better able to make predictions about likelihood of defaults. In other words over time models can predict that if ten specific things are true an eleventh is likely also true. For example knowing where someone went to school what he studied what his tax burden is where he works and what his monthly bank transactions are allows a model to extrapolate other things that increase a lender s confidence about that person s willingness and ability to repay a loan in the future. How does machine learning impact other parts of the alternative lending process Machine learning has a role to play at every stage of the process this includes customer acquisition credit scoring loan servicing and the mechanism through which loans are repaid. With customer acquisition the challenge is identifying the right borrowers people who need a loan and are likely to qualify for one. Lenders target potential borrowers digitally but somewhat surprisingly also achieve good results through direct mail campaigns. Machine learning facilitates a degree of automation in the application process as well reducing the amount of human oversight and time required to process a loan. For example if an applicant provides access to his bank account a lender can immediately verify his education income and current employer without requiring documentation for each of those three things. This means less paperwork for the applicant to gather fewer documents for the lender to review and quicker turnaround time for both parties. Over time this can translate into lower costs being passed through to the consumer. Loan servicing can also be done in an automated way. Alternative lenders generally use an automated clearinghouse to pull payments directly from a borrower s bank account no bill is sent and no paperwork is filled out on a monthly basis. Do you think there are broader applications for machine learning in the lending space In a decade we believe that most types of lending around the world will rely on machine learning as opposed to traditional models because the difference in economics is so dramatic. We have fairly reliable data that shows for a given set of borrowers in certain FICO ranges our loss rates are less than half of what we see in our industry. That is an enormous difference and it s not random. It s a fundamentally different system one that is transferable to small business real estate and auto lending.

      "Doc - Orig:  While co investing has been a staple of the private equity industry for many years it is a more recent and growing trend in the hedge fund industry. We believe that hedge fund co investments are an important tool to increase the total return of portfolios while limiting correlation to traditional asset classes and hedge fund strategies. Why are we seeing growth in hedge fund co investment opportunities Prior to the global financial crisis the hedge fund industry experienced strong inflows. Many hedge funds enjoyed relative freedom to pursue niche opportunities and put less liquid investments into side pockets. In recent years industry inflows have been more limited and investors have been more restrictive on permissible investments particularly less liquid situations. As a result hedge funds outside of mainstream liquid strategies such as equity long short and global macro have had less discretionary capital available to deploy. This has coincided with regulatory changes that have decreased bank and insurance company willingness to invest in non traditional asset classes creating more opportunity for alternative forms of capital to fill that void. The end result has been an increase in established hedge funds seeking co investment capital for discrete opportunities that do not meet the liquidity concentration or asset class guidelines of their main funds. From the investor s perspective fees transparency and correlation are key focal points when it comes to hedge fund allocations. In our view co investments have the potential to provide improvement on all three fronts. Furthermore they can provide a way for investors to target specific exposures and risk return profiles that meet their investment objectives. In short we believe co investments offer a clear and self sustaining value proposition to hedge fund managers and investors. For managers co investments represent a new form of capital that enables them to participate in high conviction opportunities that absent co investment capital they would not be able to pursue. For investors co investments offer a means of direct access to differentiated sources of return with potentially bespoke risk return profiles as well as attractive fees transparency and control rights. How do hedge fund co investments differ from private equity co investments The primary difference is the universe of managers from which co investments are sourced. Co investing is a mature concept for private equity firms. Indeed many private equity managers have established and often contractual processes for how co investments are allocated among existing clients. Co investing is a newer concept for hedge funds. Most hedge fund managers do not have a long list of existing investors with whom they have traditionally partnered on such investment opportunities. At the same time most hedge fund allocators are not equipped to make decisions about co investments. As a result these opportunities tend not to be as heavily trafficked as private equity co investments and there tends to be greater potential for tailoring implementation strategies. Another important difference is the breadth of investment strategies accessible through each of the two categories. Private equity co investments typically involve control private equity positions that are subject to the same factors that influence valuation of public equities. Hedge fund co investments represent a diverse array of asset classes liquidity profiles and risk. They can be risk on or risk off and everything in between. They can range from publicly traded equity and debt to non traded investments such as litigation finance and reinsurance which have no correlation to traditional assets classes. For this reason we would generally expect that hedge fund co investments would have lower correlation to global equities than private equity co investments. Hedge fund co investments also tend to have shorter holding periods than private equity co investments. How are hedge fund co investments sourced Today sourcing is entirely dependent upon having access to a robust network of idea generators. The most obvious sourcing channel comes from hedge fund managers with whom an investor has existing primary fund investments. However it is increasingly common for hedge fund managers to solicit co investment capital directly from allocators with whom no primary fund relationship exists. This is happening because few hedge fund managers have existing investors with active co investment programs and managers recognize co investments as an opportunity to broaden their client base and support future business growth. What are the key barriers to entry While we believe there are many potential benefits to making co investments there are challenges as well. Broadly speaking we see four key barriers to entry Sourcing Having a wide network of existing hedge funds idea generators and a pipeline for new ones is critical. The greatest advantage in this space comes from the luxury of choice having access to a wide range of potential opportunities and being selective. Analysis Co investing requires integrating a hedge fund manager due diligence framework with asset specific underwriting. Many hedge fund investors are not structured or resourced to support this two pronged approach. Execution Co investing requires efficient decision making often over the course of mere days. In addition legal documentation and vehicle structuring must be accomplished far more rapidly than is required in traditional fund investing. Capital Flexibility Co investments are often presented because the hedge fund manager has constraints on size and or liquidity that prevent inclusion of these ideas in a main fund. Investors must have the mandate and appetite to be flexible around these parameters in order to maximize their opportunity set. How is alignment typically achieved with the hedge fund manager Generally speaking alignment is achieved in two ways. It can come from assurance that a manager has skin in the game investing personal capital alongside that of external investors. And it can come through fee structures that are akin to sweat equity . There are a wide range of fee structures including no fees but structures are typically skewed toward realization based incentives over a performance hurdle whereby a manager is only compensated if the investment achieves the investor s objectives. What is the role of co investments in client portfolios What are the trade offs We believe the primary role of hedge fund co investments in client portfolios is to potentially increase expected return. Secondary benefits may include improving transparency reducing average fees and introducing targeted exposures that are not correlated to existing allocations. The trade offs are that co investments are resource intensive and require quick response times. In addition they can have higher risk and wider distributions of outcomes than traditional fund investments. Finally co investments may require more onerous contractual liquidity. Conclusion In our view hedge fund co investments have a distinct role to play in well balanced portfolios offering important diversification benefits to traditional asset classes as well as hedge funds and opportunistic investments. We believe that hedge fund co investing will reach the level of adoption currently found in private equity leaving significant runway for growth in the years ahead. \n",

for investor to target specific exposure and risk return profile that meet investment objective . in short believe co investment offer a clear and self sustain value proposition to hedge fund manager and investor . for manager co investment represent a new form of capital that enable to participate in high conviction opportunity that absent co investment capital would not be able to pursue . for investor co investment offer a means of direct access to differentiated source of return with potentially bespoke risk return profile as well as attractive fee transparency and control right . how do hedge fund co investment differ from private equity co investment the primary difference be the universe of manager from which co investment be source . co investing be a mature concept for private equity firm . indeed many private equity manager have establish and often contractual process for how co investment be allocate among exist client . co investing be a new concept for hedge fund . most hedge fund manager do not have a long list of exist investor with whom have traditionally partner on such investment opportunity . at the same time most hedge fund allocator be not equip to make decision about co investment . as a result these opportunity tend not to be as heavily traffic as private equity co investment and there tend to be great potential for tailor implementation strategy . another important difference be the breadth of investment strategy accessible through each of the two category . private equity co investment typically involve control private equity position that be subject to the same factor that influence valuation of public equity . hedge fund co investment represent a diverse array of asset class liquidity profile and risk . can be risk on or risk off and everything in between . can range from publicly trade equity and debt to non trade investment such as litigation finance and reinsurance which have no correlation to traditional asset class . for this reason would generally expect that hedge fund co investment would have low correlation to global equity than private equity co investment . hedge fund co investment also tend to have short hold period than private equity co investment . how be hedge fund co investment source today source be entirely dependent upon have access to a robust network of idea generator . the most obvious source channel come from hedge fund manager with whom an investor have exist primary fund investment . however be increasingly common for hedge fund manager to solicit co investment capital directly from allocator with whom no primary fund relationship exist . this be happen because few hedge fund manager have exist investor with active co investment program and manager recognize co investment as an opportunity to broaden client base and support future business growth . what be the key barrier to entry while believe there be many potential benefit to make co investment there be challenge as well . broadly speak see four key barrier to entry source have a wide network of exist hedge fund idea generator and a pipeline for new one be critical . the great advantage in this space come from the luxury of choice have access to a wide range of potential opportunity and be selective . analysis co investing require integrate a hedge fund manager due diligence framework with asset specific underwriting . many hedge fund investor be not structure or resource to support this two pronged approach . execution co investing require efficient decision make often over the course of mere day . in addition legal documentation and vehicle structuring must be accomplish far more rapidly than be require in traditional fund investing . capital flexibility co investment be often present because the hedge fund manager have constraint on size and or liquidity that prevent inclusion of these idea in a main fund . investor must have the mandate and appetite to be flexible around these parameter in order to maximize opportunity set . how be alignment typically achieve with the hedge fund manager generally speak alignment be achieve in two way . can come from assurance that a manager have skin in the game invest personal capital alongside that of external investor . and can come through fee structure that be akin to sweat equity . there be a wide range of fee structure include no fee but structure be typically skewed toward realization base incentive over a performance hurdle whereby a manager be only compensate if the investment achieve the investor s objective . what be the role of co investment in client portfolio what be the trade off believe the primary role of hedge fund co investment in client portfolio be to potentially increase expect return . secondary benefit may include improve transparency reduce average fee and introduce target exposure that be not correlate to exist allocation . the trade off be that co investment be resource intensive and require quick response time . in addition can have high risk and wide distribution of outcome than traditional fund investment . finally co investment may require more onerous contractual liquidity . conclusion in view hedge fund co investment have a distinct role to play in well balanced portfolio offer important diversification benefit to traditional asset class as well as hedge fund and opportunistic investment . believe that hedge fund co investing will reach the level of adoption currently find in private equity leave significant runway for growth in the year ahead .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  In 2017 a general partner GP approached Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners AIP looking for a solution to an issue faced by an increasing number of GPs. The GP managed a 2004 vintage year fund that was reaching the end of its statutory life and held an unrealized investment with meaningful growth prospects. However the 2004 fund had no remaining capital to invest in the company and the GP needed more time to fully capitalize on the growth potential of the business. The lead partner remarked I have more upside and lower risk with this asset than anything else I can buy in the market right now. Why would I sell it In the secondaries market today a compelling solution exists for GPs who encounter these situations. AIP refers to these transactions as transformational secondaries. This form of GP led secondary now comprises almost a third of the $74 billion secondary market.1 Transformational secondaries particularly transactions involving single assets are compelling because we believe they can provide key benefits beyond those typically associated with traditional limited partner LP secondaries. In addition to providing a shorter duration mitigated blind pool risk and purchase price discounts transformational secondaries seek to maximize the value of unrealized assets by providing opportunistic growth capital additional time and enhanced alignment with the GP. Single asset transactions with high quality GPs in our view enable the secondary market investor to more effectively leverage the GP s intimate knowledge of the underlying asset to collaborate with the GP in enhancing the value of the asset in its next phase of value creation and to negotiate deal terms that closely align the interests of the GP and the investor. Outside of transformational secondaries we believe that it is difficult to find transactions with this combination of potential benefits in the secondary markets today. What are transformational secondaries and why are they attractive GPs of private equity funds often find themselves having to manage a multitude of structural obstacles that inhibit their ability to unlock value in certain assets. In our experience common obstacles include Unrealized assets with untapped value potential in a fund that is approaching end of term with existing investors desiring liquidity Lack of tactical growth equity capital required to enhance value in select companies Co investors with different outlooks on certain assets and who are seeking liquidity on a different timeline Teams being spun out from captive sources of capital Need for re alignment in economic terms between GP and LPs A challenge that consistently arises for GPs in all of these situations is providing an outcome that works for all stakeholders involved. We believe that transformational secondaries can be a winning solution for the GP of the fund existing fund LPs and for the new investor. Transformational secondaries come in many forms including fund restructurings fund recapitalizations portfolio strip purchases single asset solutions and GP spinouts. Some transactions facilitate ways for GPs to hold onto a promising asset while allowing certain LPs to cash out others allow the GPs to maintain control of assets where additional capital is required. The constant across all of these transaction types is providing LPs with optionality. Structurally the asset or assets would be moved to a new special purpose vehicle with an extended term that enables these assets to reach harvest maturity. Existing investors would typically have the option to participate in the next phase of value creation of the asset or assets at no change in the economics and those who desire liquidity can potentially cash out at a fair market price. The transformational segment of the secondary market has gained significant traction in recent years as shown in Display 1 2 as a result of its attractiveness in offering a solution to all stakeholders. DISPLAY 1 GP Led Transaction Volume By Year $B Key benefits to investors particularly as it relates to single asset solutions may include HIGH DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY Buyers may typically benefit from better access to a GP company management teams and key company data allowing for deeper due diligence and improved transparency. This additional access to company management as well as to comprehensive company data is often crucial in providing the buyers with the necessary comfort and confidence to offer the most competitive price to existing investors. IMPROVED MANAGER ALIGNMENT Transformational secondaries provide an opportunity to invest with high quality GPs who are well aligned with new investors through a modification of fund economics and a meaningful commitment of GP capital. Alignment may be improved via one or more of the following mechanisms New and larger than average manager commitments to the restructured fund Re investment of any accrued carry proceeds Budgeted management fees and or Higher than average hurdle rates before the manager participates in additional carried interest We believe it is important to carefully assess a GP s intent and seek to ensure that GPs are not pursing transformational solutions for short term gains but instead because they believe in the long term potential of the assets. LIMITED COMPETITION DUE TO COMPLEXITY Transformational secondaries are highly complex transactions requiring specialized skills and experience to successfully participate in the market. In our view only a small number of players have the necessary resources and capabilities to pursue these transactions which may result in more attractive pricing and terms. Where do transformational secondaries exist Transformational secondary opportunities exist across the entire spectrum of vintage years. Older vintage funds may hold one or more unrealized companies that are currently performing well but may have taken longer than expected to create value. The initial investment may have been made during a period of cyclically high valuations or with leverage levels that may have impacted the company s ability to use cash for growth initiatives. For these reasons and others assets purchased over the last decade are facing longer holds to achieve a return target. This longer time frame often results in older vintage funds holding assets that need more time to drive a good outcome but reside within funds which need a structural solution prior to the end of their initial or extended term. As shown in Display 2 3 there is approximately $249 billion of unrealized NAV in funds that are at least a decade old. Many LPs who invested in these funds are seeking a partial or full liquidity solution for their investment. This already large and diverse market opportunity which is set against a backdrop of a favorable distribution environment we believe is well positioned for further growth in less benign distribution environments. Transformational secondaries will likely continue to expand as liquidity issues prompt GPs to consider these transaction types as a solution to structural challenges that are likely to become more pronounced. The opportunity set also exists in newer vintage vehicles. Within the newer vintages GP spinout transactions have been a common type of transformational solution. In these transactions a subset of a team leaves an existing asset manager with their assets or the prior captive backer no longer supports the growth of the private equity organization. These spinouts should continue to provide a source of transformational deals in the foreseeable future. Lastly transformational deals may provide additional growth or acquisition capital to businesses held within a portfolio that is outside its investment period. This dynamic typically did not exist prior to the advent of transformational secondaries and is proving to be an effective tool for newer vintage funds. DISPLAY 2 Unrealized NAV $B AIP s approach to this opportunity is unique The emphasis on single asset solutions and the application of a multidimensional investment framework to build a resilient portfolio is in our view a distinguishing characteristic of an approach to transformational secondaries. It is important to build a core focus around single asset solutions with single fund managers as we believe these opportunities allow for greater transparency and due diligence on the underlying portfolio companies as well as providing potentially stronger partnership with the GPs. More importantly there is often a positive selection bias on the part of the GP in identifying the strongest asset in their remaining portfolio where a transformational secondary opportunity may exist. As buyers this bias can provide comfort regarding the GP s level of conviction around the growth prospect for that company. Furthermore there is a growing prevalence of single asset transactions in the market from tail end funds where there may be a dominant unrealized asset within a portfolio to younger more recent vintages with an identified single asset requiring a specific solution. As discussed in the team s previous whitepaper Where to Next A Framework for Resilience AIP has developed a three pronged investment philosophy centered on selecting assets that can withstand challenging economic environments. The core tenets of this philosophy are i identifying efficiency producing businesses with exposure to stable end markets ii partnering with highly aligned and specialized investment partners and iii seeking value on the buy with businesses exhibiting high cash flow generation and conservative leverage. In conclusion we believe that transformational secondaries are likely to be an increasingly important component of the secondaries market in the future. The opportunity set for transformational secondaries continues to grow and take on various forms as these transactions are used to achieve a widening range of objectives. It is driven by a fundamental need to solve structural limitations that exist in private equity in a way that can be beneficial for all stakeholders. AIP believes that successful navigation of the issues related to single asset transformational secondaries can offer significant upside potential for investors who take the time and have the patience to complete these structurally complex transactions. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As we have said before the good news about equities is that there are only two ways to lose money falling earnings or falling multiples. At the end of 2017 we were worried about the market s multiple. Following the de rating in 2018 our main anxiety shifted to earnings. In one sense this anxiety has proved relatively well placed with 2019 estimates for the MSCI World Index down 7% since the start of the year. But in a more important sense we were wrong to worry as markets have ignored the subsiding earnings and revived strongly. The MSCI World Index s multiple of 2019 earnings has surged from 13.4x to 16.5x boosted by the monetary generosity of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Mr. Draghi at the European Central Bank. The multiple is probably helped by the perennial assumption of future earnings growth with 2020 earnings expected to be 10% higher than 2019 arguably not a safe assumption. Our global portfolios have performed strongly in this environment up over 20% in 2019 so far and outperforming the index. Part of this has come from the resilient earnings holding up better than the market but there has also been a re rating. Our global portfolios are now trading on 20 21x the next 12 months earnings and on this measure are at a 28% 36% premium to the MSCI World Index versus a 19% 35% average premium since the Global Financial Crisis GFC or for those launched more recently their inception dates. Our portfolios are less prone to the curse of adjusted earnings or earnings before the bad stuff than the market as a whole Our priority is naturally absolute valuations but looking at the relative position it is our view that the portfolios should trade at a significant premium to the general market. The companies combination of recurring revenue and pricing power should protect revenues and margins and thus earnings in any downturn indeed our flagship global portfolio s earnings went up during the GFC. In addition our portfolios earnings are less prone to the curse of adjusted earnings or earnings before the bad stuff than the market as a whole be it ignoring paying employees in shares restructuring charges or write offs. In the U.S. alone $600 billion or 21% has disappeared between the adjusted number and the actual profit and loss statements over the last three years. The final point is that the high returns on capital of the companies in the portfolio drive a distinctly stronger free cash flow conversion than the market meaning that any premium is significantly lower in free cash flow terms. We would also argue that it is reasonable that the portfolios premiums are higher than usual at the moment as they are less affected than the general market by some of the current market worries be they the current drift down in earnings estimates the impact of falling interest rates on financials the possible effects of a worsening trade war or even an end to this very elongated economic cycle. If any of these scenarios bite the market s expectations for near double digit earnings growth in 2020 could prove distinctly optimistic while history suggests our portfolios earnings may well be rather more robust. Interestingly the relative re rating does not seem to have happened across the board but rather has been concentrated in the growthier part of the portfolios. We are not growth investors so by growthier we mean companies with medium term top line growth outlooks in the mid to high single digits as opposed to the 3% 5% top line growth in some of the steadier plays in the portfolios or the double digit growth sought after by growth investors. Consumer staples between 20% 40% of our global portfolios can be seen as a rough proxy for the steadier side of the portfolio. The sector as a whole is currently trading at a 21% premium to the MSCI World Index on the next 12 months earnings very much in line with the post GFC average of 22%. The consumer staples stocks in our portfolio are actually trading at a slight discount to the sector as a whole. MSCI World Consumer Staples PE Relative to MSCI World Index Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management and FactSet. The growth of recurring cloud based software revenues means the companies should be more robust in a downturn The software services sub sector within information technology which is around 30% 32% of our global portfolios can be seen as a proxy for the growthier side of the portfolio. This has re rated to a 58% premium to the MSCI World Index the level last seen before the GFC. While our portfolio holdings are at a slight discount to the sub sector as a whole they have re rated as well. Looking at our holdings we would argue that the re rating is understandable and that the current multiples are defensible. With the growth of the cloud the whole software industry has gone through a major transition. This shift suppressed multiples for a while due to perfectly reasonable doubts about companies ability to manage the transition aggravated by the pressure on margins as they built their new offerings. As they have started to emerge from the other side it has become clearer that they are well placed in the new environment while margins have started to recover as the cloud propositions approach scale most notably at an American multinational technology company we own. In addition there is the extra plus that the growth of cloud based SaaS Software as a Service revenues at the expense of traditional lumpy software sales means that the companies are more skewed to recurring revenue which should make them more robust in a downturn. The revenues of a German multinational software company we own went from 43% to 65% recurring between 2008 and 2018 with the percentage still rising as the strong cloud growth continues. MSCI World Software Services PE Relative to MSCI World Index Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management and FactSet. While we are generally comfortable with the absolute valuations of the growthier names that we own both in software services and beyond we have reacted to the re rating move. Since the start of 2018 we have made net additions to consumer staples and health care and reductions to the growthier software services and consumer discretionary sectors across our global portfolios. Looking across the sectors there have been around net sales of the growthier stocks those with estimated medium term sales growth above 6% with the cash being shifted to the steadier side of the portfolios. We remain confident in the resilience of our holdings earnings and their ability to compound As we mentioned at the start of the piece there are two ways to lose money in equities falling earnings and falling multiples. For the market as a whole we worry about both given that both are high earnings look vulnerable and the current combination of falling earnings with rising multiples is unlikely to be sustainable. Multiples also look fairly full for the portfolios in absolute terms at least and we clearly cannot preclude the possibility of a multiple driven drawdown. However we do remain confident in the resilience of our holdings earnings and their ability to compound. Over the medium term such compounding should mitigate any erosion of multiples. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Understanding management quality When we interact directly with a company s management we raise issues we consider material and relevant. This helps us assess management quality and their short and long term priorities. For over 20 years we have emphasized the importance of understanding management priorities and corporate governance in our investment process. It is not enough to have a profitable company with phenomenal returns if those returns are not sustainable. For this reason after identifying high return companies we ask Is management focused on maintaining a company s returns by allocating capital wisely Is it incentivized to strive for long term returns over short term earnings If a company does not get the governance factor right it is unlikely that it will be on the right side of the two other ESG pillars environmental and social factors High quality companies require extra scrutiny For the types of high quality companies held in our portfolios including Global Sustain the latest addition to our global equity strategies these questions matter even more because management has discretion over how to deploy large amounts of cash flow. The decisions they make can influence returns over years to come. That s why we believe governance is central to sustainable long term performance. Also if a company does not get the governance factor right it is unlikely that it will be on the right side of the two other ESG pillars environmental and social factors. And that s why portfolio manager led engagement is so valuable. Much of the governance industry concentrates on scoring what is easily measured and ends up ticking boxes neglecting the human element. As such we see governance scores from the likes of MSCI and Sustainalytics as having limited value beyond raising potential flags. We support corporates having a separate Chair and CEO but this is of limited use if the Chair is somehow in the CEO s pocket From an opportunity perspective new management or changes in management often present the most interesting investment opportunities. We engage directly and often We held 466 management meetings last year 215 of which included ESG engagements. We also liaise with the firm s corporate governance team on proxy voting and specific engagements with companies. The assets we manage and the concentrated nature of the portfolios give us significant influence in our engagement program We control over 1% of the free float in more than half the companies in the Global Sustain portfolio our newest strategy. As long term shareholders our portfolio turnover is low allowing us to build long term influential relationships with management teams. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  At the time of writing 31 October 2018 the MSCI World Index experienced its first more than 10% correction since early 2016. Market commentators attribute the correction to a range of factors including rising interest rates rising energy costs due to supply constraints and environmental regulation political upheavals in Italy and the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. As usual we have no edge in determining whether or not this is the start of a more persistent market slowdown or just a temporary blip. However it may be helpful to lay out in a bit more detail why we believe our portfolios are positioned to better navigate these challenges using the trade tensions as an example How this affects the bottom line depends on the degree of pricing power a company has How to assess the impact of rising protectionism Most analyses we see on the trade tensions attempt to estimate the impact of import barriers on gross domestic product GDP . There seems to be no consensus on the extent of the impact but the European Central Bank estimates a 0.75% direct and indirect impact on global GDP relative to baseline for the first year.1 GDP can be a useful tool in forecasting demand for individual products but in this specific case it may actually be quite misleading. Trade wars have a direct impact on GDP through two channels On the one hand higher import tariffs reduce the purchasing power of households resulting in lower consumption. This negative impact on GDP is partially offset by higher prices for imported goods inducing consumers and firms to switch to domestically produced goods which in turn increases domestic demand and reduces exports. To put it simply applying an import tariff on say cars may reduce the demand for foreign produced cars but that negative effect is partially offset by an increase in demand for domestically produced cars. So the GDP impact is partially mitigated. For global companies that make up the bulk of the indices this mitigation does not happen. First they see a fall in absolute demand for their products as prices rise in line with the import tariffs. Furthermore if customers then shift to domestically produced items these companies have to move production from more efficient locations to less efficient often smaller domestic facilities. So they get hit on both volume and margin plus have to wear the capex expense of the relocation. The severity of the margin impact depends on the degree of pricing power share of recurring revenues and depth of the supply chain This example assumes a simplified fully vertically integrated production model. In reality the world has become deeply integrated over the last 30 years and parts are produced and assembled wherever this can be done in the most efficient way. Apple for instance has over 200 suppliers spread all over the world but mostly in Asia which deliver their goods to the major manufacturing base in China. Only 46% of the value added of electrical and optical equipment exported from China is actually generated in China.2 If this supply chain gets disrupted and production has to be split across multiple locations effects of scale and scope across the value chain are lost. The question of whether this loss of efficiencies affects the company bottom line very much depends on the degree of pricing power and the share of recurring revenues. In most industries companies do not have the pricing power to push higher cost through to customers and experience sharp falls in revenues as demand drops. Some companies are better than others Our bottom up investment approach focuses on pricing power and recurring revenues as a key component of the quality assessment. Additionally our approach to risk focuses on among other things potential challenges to the underlying franchise of the company which includes the supply chain. As a result our portfolios tend to be weighted towards consumer staples software services and health care which we believe to be more resilient in a trade war scenario than other sectors. Consumer staples companies tend to have relatively short supply chains as a lot of their products do not travel well. More importantly staples revenues are usually recurring revenues i.e. purchases are made regularly and are more difficult to postpone. Consumers can delay the purchase of a new dishwasher car mobile phone by another year but they need to buy their soap washing tabs baby food or bin bags every week or month. Furthermore these items tend to be sold for modest individual amounts. Hence price increases to compensate for import taxes or lower production efficiency could be passed on to the customers more easily and quickly than in other sectors. Within the sector we find some companies have stronger brands and market positions than others making them even more capable of improving economics through price product mix. Our portfolios tend to be weighted towards sectors we believe to be more resilient in a trade war scenario. Software services companies are generally less affected by traditional import taxes since they do not have supply chains in the traditional sense. To the extent tariffs are applied to their products strong pricing power allows them to pass these on to the customer base in full. For example where products have already moved to an ongoing subscription model via the cloud providers have an effective means to get customers to participate in the shift of economics. However one area of concern is where we have seen restrictions on people movement for example with reduced availability of short term work visas. Whilst these kinds of restrictions can have negative repercussions in this case they have been beneficial for consulting companies operating on a cost plus basis that already have a large part of their workforce in high cost locations. Health care is also an industry with fairly short supply chains. Most of the value lies in research and development and or highly sophisticated production capabilities. Given these products are patent protected or hard to replicate of truly vital importance and that governments tend to foot most of the health care bill import tariffs on health care products are fairly rare. Even if they were to be applied health care providers have the pricing power to pass these through to their end customers. Sectors where we would expect trade wars to have a more severe direct impact on volumes and margins are industrials materials and information technology hardware manufacturers driven by their limited ability to pass through higher costs to customers as well as in some cases the dependency on deep and complex supply chains built over the last decade. Our portfolios continue to be heavily skewed towards the three sectors we regard as more robust consumer staples software services and health care since we focus on high recurring returns and pricing power. We remain cautious on industrials materials and financials despite some improvement in valuations. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As climate change impacts intensify around the world so too do the economic impacts. Corporations communities and investors worldwide face both acute risks from single severe weather events such as droughts floods or hurricanes and chronic risks from long term changes in natural cycles and weather patterns.1 Sectors built on physical assets including real estate and infrastructure are on the frontline of these climate impacts posing challenges for real assets investors. A New Operating Reality Amid rising average global temperatures severe weather events have become increasingly frequent and destructive. For many places long term climate impacts like sea level rise are combining with changing land use patterns such as urbanization to exacerbate risks to the built environment. The results can be costly. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration since the 1980s the number of inflation adjusted billion dollar weather and climate disaster events in the U.S. per decade grew from 28 during the 1980s to 91 from 2010 to 2017. Meanwhile the average annual costs rose from $16.7 billion in the 1980s to $80.5 billion from 2010 to 2017. In 2017 alone the United States experienced 16 weather and climate disasters with losses greater than $1 billion costing the economy a record $309 billion.2 While not every event can be directly linked to climate change its impact is increasingly clear. For example researchers found that climate change likely increased Hurricane Harvey s record rainfall intensity by at least 20 percent.3 The impact on the Houston area s housing and infrastructure was profound with nearly 800 000 people in need of assistance in the weeks and months that followed.4 Facing such risks cities and states globally have begun to adopt policies programs and investments to mitigate and adapt to climate change including by making infrastructure and buildings more resilient. Companies have been following suit seeing the benefits to be gained from anticipating responding to and recovering from climate risks and impacts. Investors in real assets are also compelled to act on the risk and opportunities afforded by adapting to a climate changed world. FIGURE 1 Average Annual Cost of Natural Disasters Source NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information NCEI U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters 2018 . https www.ncdc.noaa.gov billions FIGURE 2 Annual Severe Storm Events 1980 2017 Source NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information NCEI U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters 2018 . https www.ncdc.noaa.gov billions Resilience and Real Assets Climate resilience is fast becoming an investment imperative in real assets where investments are often held for 10 years or more. In 2017 property and infrastructure damage from natural disasters accounted for an estimated $220 billion 5 or two thirds of $330 billion in global economic losses.6 Recognizing the need for investment in infrastructure globally the UN Sustainable Development Goals have defined resilient infrastructure as a global imperative Goal 9 . Beyond purchasing insurance however not all investors with significant real asset portfolio exposure are managing the long term risks associated with these investments.8 In failing to understand this exposure they not only ignore growing risk but also miss out on the potential high returns of resilience efforts. These can include cost reductions lower operating costs and averted damage revenue growth enhanced reputation increased occupancy rates and higher asset value.9 Faced with the prospect of more frequent billion dollar weather events how should real assets investors protect their investments with respect to climate resilience In this paper Morgan Stanley Real Assets proposes a dual approach first assessing risk and second optimizing assets for climate resilience. Achieving these goals will require scrutinizing assets exposure and vulnerability to climate impacts as well as employing multiple defenses to minimize disruption to buildings and infrastructure. The next two sections provide a roadmap for maximizing resilience through a combination of due diligence forward looking design proactive disruption management and thoughtful divesting of certain assets. Investing in climate resilient portfolios will require tradeoffs and judgment calls. For example coastal locations that make highly attractive real estate investments are also very vulnerable to climate impacts related to rising sea levels. A World Bank OECD study of the coastal cities most at risk from flooding is a case in point including such major markets as Miami New York Boston Osaka Guangzhou and Mumbai.10 Similarly a planned new building in a location such as a flood plain that is insurable today may not be insurable two decades down the road leaving investors at risk of substantial future diminution in value. Depending on the asset in some cases the return will be worth the risk and investors can pursue ways to fortify it. In others divestment from certain markets or of specific assets may ultimately be the soundest option. Investors in infrastructure assets will face similar choices in the years ahead since airports cell towers and oil and gas pipelines are often located in areas at increasing risks from flooding severe storms and extreme heat. For example the European Commission s Joint Research Center predicts that damage costs from natural disasters to critical infrastructure including transport systems energy generation plants and water supply networks could triple to 9.3 billion per year across the EU by the 2020s.11 At the same time investments in resilient real estate and infrastructure may offer prospects for improved financial returns. A comprehensive evaluation of climate risk can help real assets investors accurately weigh risks and returns. Balancing resilience concerns and market attractiveness will be an important focus for investors and fund managers as they increasingly apply a climate lens to their investments. Many of the most core real estate markets in the United States and globally are in coastal areas subject to sea level rise hurricanes and storm surges. But an investor that only considers climate risk may miss valuable market opportunities. A careful analysis of risk and returns is central to climate resilient investing. Defining Resilience Resilience is an organization s ability to prepare plan for respond to and recover from adverse natural or human caused events. Stresses can arise at the national regional city submarket asset business or investment level and can encompass multiple types of threat. Resilient organizations enhance their adaptive capacity by making changes in processes practices or structures to moderate or offset potential damages or to take advantage of opportunities associated with changes in climate.7 In this paper resilience refers solely to climate and other environmental related risks. A Balancing Act Carefully weighing risk resilience and potential returns in tandem allows investors to identify attractive climate resilient real estate markets in a more comprehensive way than considering metrics in isolation. For example the University of California Berkeley s Resilience Capacity Index a 12 metric average that quantifies the resilience capacity of 361 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas includes preferences for higher homeownership rates overall housing affordability and the share of the metro population in place for at least a year. Although these metrics help to prioritize stability they may not correlate as well with income growth and total returns. When these resilience scores are plotted against trailing 20 year real estate returns for 46 U.S. markets measured by the NCREIF Property Index we see the correlation is 0.23 .12 The most resilient cities do not always offer the highest returns to real estate investors. A narrow view of only resilience OR returns could guide investors to different real estate markets while an analysis of both can highlight cities that are attractive on both dimensions.

Assessing Climate Risk for Real Assets A Three Dimensional Approach Against this backdrop how can investors begin to evaluate real assets for climate risks and potential opportunities A systematic approach aimed at mitigating potential risks while maximizing opportunity requires paying close attention to investment opportunities in a three dimensional way. FIGURE 4 A Three Dimensional Approach to Assessing Climate Risk Hazard When looking at any given market from a climate impact perspective investors should first ascertain the likely hazards the area faces. What types of extreme events can occur What is the likelihood given climate models of a hazard occurring and over what time horizon Climate related hazards can take many forms and be deeply interrelated. As the climate changes in new and unpredictable ways certain changes may set off feedback loops. Warming temperatures accelerate sea level rise both through glacial melting and thermal expansion. Droughts can exacerbate wildfires which in turn can contribute to the frequency and severity of landslides. Current insurance models account for historical patterns but those models may not apply in a changing climate. Investors should consider how those hazards will change over time as well as how they are related. Exposure After establishing potential hazards investors should evaluate the exposure to expected climate impacts faced by their investments. Does a market or asset lie directly in the path of one or more potential hazards To what extent are buildings and infrastructure situated in areas exposed to acute climate related events or slow build impacts For example more than 60 percent of the world s population lives in Asia and more than half of Asians live near the coast making their property and infrastructure directly exposed to sea level rise.13 In the United States Hurricane Sandy offers a prime example of the kind of acute damage to which rising sea levels can contribute when peak storm surges caused more than $70 billion worth of damage in New York and New Jersey.14 Due to sea level rise storm surges are an estimated eight inches higher than in 1900.15 According to Lloyd s of London the 20cm rise in sea level at the tip of Manhattan since the 1950s has increased insured losses in New York by 30 percent.16 Given the longevity of many real assets taking long term climate modeling into account is critical to sound risk assessment. For such information investors can turn to publicly available data sources such as the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. Maintained by U.S. government agencies the portal provides current conditions short term forecasts and longer term projections for 2035 and 2060 under varying climatological models. The maps in Figure 5 show the potential increase in intensity across U.S. markets of one in 100 year storms in 2035 and 2060. Such predictions and their implications for real assets are also complicated by the extent to which the international community reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades. By 2070 $35 trillion in real estate assets will be at risk if the world does not change its current carbon emissions trajectory according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC .18 At the asset level investors should consider the relative exposure of a specific asset given local conditions. For example in a market at high risk of flooding from sea level rise is a specific property coastal or inland Does it sit above sea level or below Investors have traditionally relied on insurance to reduce exposure to risks and will continue to do so as the climate changes. With the insurance industry facing increasingly unsustainable climate related losses however the old models will no longer suffice. Insurance models will need to assess risk in a changing climate and investors can work with insurers to find the way forward see the Role of Insurance . FIGURE 5 Projected Change in 100 Year Storm Intensity % Source U.S. EPA CREAT Climate Scenarios Projection Map as of March 2018.17 Vulnerability Once hazard and exposure today and in the future are established the final element of climate risk assessment is to ascertain vulnerability. How prepared are the local community infrastructure and government to respond to disasters What is the likelihood of people ecosystems economic sectors supply chains or local businesses to suffer adverse effects from climate related physical hazards and how might these affect real assets investments At a national level macroeconomic capacity can make investments in real assets less risky. For example countries with a higher literacy rate better institutions higher per capita income higher degree of openness to trade and higher levels of government spending are better able to withstand and recover from natural disasters.19 Similarly abundance of financial capital in the form of deeper domestic credit markets and foreign exchange resources can speed recovery. At the city level investors can look to collaborations and analyses of resilience for guidance. For example the Rockefeller Foundation s 100 Resilient Cities program acts as a clearinghouse for best practices in urban resilience working with mayor s offices of 100 cities worldwide. Participating cities commit to addressing a range of social and environmental challenges those committing to address climate change reflect a global network including London Santiago and Los Angeles.20 Resilience analyses such as the Resilience Capacity Index see A Balancing Act consider the ways that socioeconomic and environmental factors come together to promote resilience. As resilience relates to a specific asset which characteristics make it vulnerable in an extreme event To answer this question investors evaluate every relevant aspect of their investment. When was the asset built and with what materials What types of tenants and uses occupy the space Does the property have storm windows and drains in place If the location is flood prone is the electrical equipment in the basement which would make it vulnerable to damage and longer disruption or on the rooftop Such details can make a significant difference to damages and costs from a weather or climate event. For example a mixed use project in Boston that incorporated resilience features including elevated mechanical systems seawalls and saltwater tolerant landscaping found 2 to 18 percent higher rents and reduced its actuarial flood loss expectancy by 90 percent.21 By ascertaining the extent to which an asset is prepared for a changing climate investors can make informed decisions on whether current or future investments are sound. The Role of Insurance in Managing Climate Risk Real assets investors rely on insurance to help mitigate climate related risk. Paying insurance premiums to enable rebuilding after extreme weather events for example enables investors to support otherwise attractive property markets in regions with high climate risk exposure. However today s insurance models are becoming outdated and unsustainable as climate risks intensify and the cost of losses grows. The $330 billion in global natural catastrophe insured and uninsured losses in 2017 was the second highest annual total to date after $354 billion in 2011 while the total insured losses set a new record at $135 billion.22 Given that historical data may not accurately benchmark future risk pricing climate risk into property insurance premiums is difficult and poses a challenge to current insurance practices. The implications are twofold climate risk today may be underpriced by insurance markets and as models begin to price climate risk more accurately premiums may rise and in some cases assets may become uninsurable. The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP Finance Initiative established the Principles for Sustainable Insurance in 2012 to develop a common framework for the industry to address environmental social and governance opportunities including the risks of climate change. They guide insurers to embed environmental criteria into decision making across business including in risk management and underwriting processes which in time will necessitate a more direct approach to pricing climate risk. More than 83 organizations have adopted the Principles which represent more than 20 percent of global insurance premiums.23 Investors can play an active role in how all this unfolds by working with insurers to bolster the resilience of real estate and infrastructure to prevent jumps in premiums and to preserve the long term insurability of their most at risk assets. Some insurers are now developing rating systems for real estate and infrastructure around asset exposure and vulnerability to severe weather events and other climate related hazards.24 By applying a ratings approach insurers would foster best practices in terms of building design and preparedness by real asset owners bringing benefits to investors and communities. Insurers could also offer the ability to insure a set of assets as a geographically diversified portfolio rather than at the single asset level enabling a more diversified approach to managing climate risk. To help keep premiums down and incentivize climate resilience improvements real assets investors can also press insurers for multi year insurance contracts that reflect their commitments. The chief research officer of insurance brokerage RMS has signaled that insurers would be prepared to invest in risk reduction if they knew someone guaranteed to stay insuring with them as through some multi year insurance contract. 25 By partnering with the insurance industry as it evolves to more effectively price the risks of climate change to real assets investors can help shape a more sustainable and resilient path forward. Building Climate Resilience Across a Real Asset s Lifecycle Once investors understand the risks to current or potential real assets investments presented by climate hazards exposure and vulnerability how can they act on them Morgan Stanley Real Assets believes that considering resilience across an asset s lifecycle can help investors and asset managers make better decisions minimize risk and capture the opportunities that climate resilient buildings and infrastructure will increasingly offer. FIGURE 6 A Lifecycle Approach to Managing Climate Risk Due Diligence The first step is for property or infrastructure investors to apply due diligence criteria to climate hazards exposure and vulnerability as they would with other risk factors such as financial economic and political circumstances. Due diligence in a climate context involves a three step process identify risks determine potential outcome severity and recommend actions to improve the property s resilience to the identified threats. This revolves around the concept that prior to investment establishing a baseline set of resilience standards should be considered. In identifying risks investors should first consider market level conditions including potential exposure to any and all severe weather events other geological and climate changerelated hazards and non climate related conditions that can exacerbate damage. As previously noted historical baselines may not fully measure future conditions so analysis should incorporate publicly available data sources such as the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. If investors green light an investment they should gauge the building pipeline or facility s ability to withstand the identified threats and recover operations after suffering damage as well as its ability to withstand longer term changes in climate systems. This view of resilience can be taken through the engineering lens of the four Rs robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity the speed of response to disruptions .26 Where investors find gaps or vulnerabilities in emergency and resilience management they can take action to protect their assets. Due diligence supports sound investing by determining the approximate costs associated with options to improve the asset s resilience to identified threats. These can be significant for seismic property retrofits for example the city of Santa Monica California enacted programs with costs to building owners estimated at up to $50 to $100 per square foot for concrete and steel buildings and $5 000 to $10 000 per unit for wood apartment buildings.27 Careful consideration of the costs involved to enhance resilience is essential at all stages of the investment cycle especially given the expectation that climate hazards and resulting impacts will intensify over time. Design Once an investment is made investors can address asset level vulnerabilities by implementing design improvements that enhance climate resilience by addressing robustness and redundancy. As the risks to real assets from extreme weather and ongoing climate change become clearer resilient design is a focus area for the sector with industry wide best practices and standards being adopted and developed for both new construction and for retrofits. For investors using such standards and credentials can provide useful guidance in designing a new asset or retrofitting an existing one. Credentials can also offer positive brand opportunities and can bring benefits beyond those triggered if a climate event strikes and resilience measures are in place. The Urban Land Institute s Ten Principles for Building Resilience offer best practices for incorporating resilience into real assets by taking a view of economic environmental and social factors together. Meanwhile the National Institute of Building Sciences has documented the costs and benefits of designing new buildings that are more robust to climate change. In a 2017 report its researchers found that investing in hazard mitigation measures that exceed relevant requirements of the International Code Council s 2015 model building codes could save $4 for every $1 spent.28 Enhancing robustness and redundancy requires designing building and renovating assets with specific hazards in mind. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of extreme temperatures both hot and cold. Buildings at risk of heatwave triggered power outages can support redundancy by upgrading back up generator capacity. Orienting and shading buildings to reduce heating and cooling needs or installing glazed glass operable windows or super insulated building envelopes can enhance energy efficiency and make a building more robust to extreme temperatures. Moving power lines below ground and upgrading insulation can protect local electricity grids during heatwaves as well as storms and earthquakes . Water system upgrades can help prevent against cooling water shortages for facilities such as power plants. For assets vulnerable to impacts from droughts buildings can install drought tolerant landscaping and make use of rainwater gray water collection and reuse systems. Natural landscaping and rooftop gardens can also help reduce cooling loads in regions where drought is exacerbated by heat waves. To withstand flooding conditions from storm surges heavy rain or rising sea levels asset managers can raise mechanical equipment and backup generators above ground level to help minimize power interruptions. Backup power systems can also keep interiors air conditioned reducing the chance of mold or mildew developing during power interruption. Landscaping with native plants bioswales and raised berms can help protect against storm surges and tides and absorb stormwater runoff.30 Storm surges and flooding are often accompanied by high wind conditions during hurricanes or typhoons. Storm rated wind resistant windows prevent damage by withstanding the stress of high winds or impact from projectiles. Designated refuge areas or interior rooms can protect building occupants by providing shelter during storms. Infrastructure assets are designed with lifespans of several decades or more and will accordingly need to adapt to longterm changes in climate systems and the frequency of extreme weather events over time. For example airport runways roads and rail transport in regions faced with intensifying heatwaves will likely need to be designed to tolerate greater heat. Bridges and oil and gas pipelines may need modifications to withstand more frequent flooding and support redundancy in the case of an event. Flood barriers are already in use to protect London and coastlines in the Netherlands and are due to be implemented in Venice during 2018. In the coming decades such defenses may also be needed in U.S. Eastern seaboard cities such as Boston and New York. Communications infrastructure is of critical importance during and after an extreme weather event yet these systems themselves are vulnerable to damage. Redundant systems can help ensure continuity and thereby enable other community response systems to mobilize quickly. For example as wireless telecommunications networks can be vulnerable to damage from hurricanes flooding and earthquakes networks can build in redundant data centers and alternative fiber rings which would allow continued operations even if the main systems are disrupted. Investors who keep on top of design modifications and best practices for resilient infrastructure will not only protect against risk but may see the value of their assets rise as demand grows for services such as continuously available electricity and air conditioning in a changing climate. Design Credentials There are a range of credentials programs investors can look to for guidance on environmental design and resilience. Some of the most widely recognized credentials include RELi In November 2017 U.S. Green Building Council USGBC introduced a new resilient design rating system known as RELi a tool for assessing building and community resilience to severe weather and climate events. RELi builds on LEED guidelines piloted in 2015 which included planning for climate change and emergencies designating and designing for a building s top three hazards and establishing design of passive survivability a property s ability to tolerate long term interruption of power heating fuel or water. PEER certification USGBC also offers sustainability and resilience infrastructure credentials for power networks and micro grids through its PEER certification Performance Excellence in Electricity Renewal . Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB GRESB measures real estate and infrastructure companies sustainability performance including a new resilience module in 2018. Envision For infrastructure assets the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure offers the Envision credential which includes climate and risk as one of five sustainability categories.29 Companies are rated on factors including resiliency criteria creating a climate impact assessment and adaptation plan and designing measures that safeguard against natural hazards promote long term resilience and adaptive capability and avoid traps and vulnerabilities. DESIGNING FOR THE FUTURE Designing for resilience will also be an iterative process. As the scope and frequency of climate events change design standards and best practices will evolve. In designing for today best practice considers projections for mean sea level and the likelihood of 10 year 50 year and 100 year storms in the future. These parameters however may evolve depending on how climate change impacts play out in the coming decades. This obviously affects new construction requiring investors to consider leading edge design features and standards in order to safeguard assets against unknowable future threats. Designing for future use also requires consideration of the ways that individuals and communities will use infrastructure buildings and real assets in the future. In designing systems intended to last for 10 20 or 50 years climate aware investors should consider the ways that systems can and will change. Advances in fuel sources communications networks and distribution systems have the potential to impact how today s infrastructure investments are used in the future. How and where those investments are made can impact the ability of a community to respond to climate events both the ability to access critical resources and the speed of response. Additionally both near and long term resilience measures for any real asset could be blunted if the local government s approach to managing climate risk is inadequate. This means that investors should be evaluating not only the design of their own assets but also the potential need for upgrades to surrounding infrastructure such as roads water systems sewers and electrical lines. Infrastructure systems are often interrelated and the resilience of a single asset is dependent on the ability of the surrounding infrastructure to anticipate withstand and respond to adverse events. For a real assets investor the more effective and long lasting that municipal resilience policies are the better. Disruption Management The third phase in the roadmap for investors to build real assets resilience is proactive disruption management. This involves creating systems and processes that ensure resourcefulness and rapidity as part of business continuity planning. While some disruption is inevitable during severe weather events effective real asset management considers resilience before during and after such disasters which can make a big difference to the human and economic consequences. Before an event is on the radar pre establishing contract terms and obligations with key suppliers will prove valuable in the aftermath of extreme weather events since taking bids on repair or replacement after the storm drives up costs and exacerbates delays. Pre positioning supplies and readying a detailed list of potential contacts are also important to have in place ahead of time. Because roads and bridges are at risk in extreme weather events key personnel could have difficulty reaching the site. Advance planning is helpful to prepare for such a possibility and provisions to shelter in place along with backup personnel and off site duplicate hard copy records may be useful. By considering the ways that resources can be accessed and mobilized ahead of time investors can thereby enhance the rapidity of a disaster response. In immediate recovery from severe weather events the focus should be on sustaining life and then restoring facility operations to full capacity. With these addressed design and disruption management are iteratively connected. Some missed imperatives in minimizing disruption may be obvious while others could be uncovered by thorough after the fact briefing. Additional resiliency measures can then be assessed and ideally put in place. Divest In balancing resilience concerns market attractiveness and cost benefit analysis investors may conclude that a potential or current asset does not meet the necessary thresholds or criteria to justify an investment. Where returns no longer balance with risks investors or fund managers may opt to divest. Such decisions may be made as a result of due diligence or during ongoing assessment and review of a portfolio or an individual asset s performance. Alternatively investors may choose to set gating criteria for resilience measures for an asset a market or both. Investors planning for climate resilience can take lessons from other types of natural phenomena such as seismic activity. Where baseline criteria are not met it is important to evaluate the costs of necessary upgrades and if feasible make the improvements. These standards help avoid investing in real estate with lateral load resistance and other metrics below pre agreed criteria to withstand earthquakes. Given the long duration of real asset lifecycles and intensifying climate hazards investors should thoughtfully consider climate risk at all stages of an investment continually making decisions about design disruption management and divestment that enable them to build and manage a resilient portfolio for the long term. Lincoln Road Retail Miami Resilience in Action Every year millions of tourists visit Miami Florida from all over the world drawn to beautiful beaches a booming nightlife and a rich cultural history. Business is thriving as well with annual business establishment growth of 2 percent from 2010 2015 more than double the national average.31 Amidst the glitz and glamour it s easy to forget that Miami is one of the United States most at risk cities in the face of climate change. Miami s overall costs to coastal property from sea level rise through 2100 are modeled at roughly $80 billion the second highest in the United States after Tampa.32 At the heart of South Beach sits Lincoln Road a popular shopping and tourism district. Across all phases of the investment lifecycle it is important to consider climate risk and put systems in place to increase the property s resilience to climate change. DUE DILIGENCE Due diligence research and analysis identified sea level rise and hurricanes as potential threats to Lincoln Road but also took into account the potential returns of owning and operating a retail property in one of the United States most popular markets for dining and entertainment. In the end investors might determine the benefits of investing in the property outweigh the risks and focus on designing and managing the building with resilience in mind. DESIGN The retail buildings at Lincoln Road include robust design features like impact windows and raised grading to withstand heavy winds and debris as well as flooding. Mechanical equipment is raised above ground level to prevent water damage. The city has existing plans to upgrade stormwater drains to mitigate flooding. During severe storms flood panels can be used to help prevent damage to facilities and to tenants merchandise. DISRUPTION MANAGEMENT Perhaps most important are the systems in place at Lincoln Road that ensure resourcefulness and rapidity in the event of an emergency. Emergency response plans are preestablished with clear lines of authority for decision making and spending. Duplicate copies of emergency plans are stored offsite in the event that the facilities cannot be accessed or electronic systems are down. On site critical resources and supplies including emergency contact lists are stored in easily and safely accessible locations on upper floors enabling personnel to carry out response plans uninterrupted. Shelter in place protocols are established as well to ensure that anyone left on site can remain safe during a storm and after in the event that roads or bridges are inaccessible. The site manager has pre established contracts in place with key suppliers to repair and replace buildings or equipment quickly and cost effectively. Facilities staff help carry out emergency plans they are hired on a contract basis so additional support can be brought in as needed. In short while Lincoln Road may be exposed and vulnerable to climate related hazards such as hurricanes careful planning across the investment lifecycle means assessing climate risks establishing a resilience strategy and helping protect the site against physical and safety risks in the event of an emergency. Conclusion This brief highlights the necessity for real assets investors to evaluate and act on climate risk to safeguard their investments. It also showcases the financial and reputational opportunities that resilient property and infrastructure can offer. As populations continue to urbanize real asset value will become ever more concentrated in urban centers which in turn will become the frontline for climate resilience and adaptation. By conducting due diligence pursuing design that prepares for a climate changed world and working with insurers municipal authorities and other stakeholders to promote resilience investors can play an important role in this evolution. Below we suggest actionable questions that can serve as a starting point for assessing and building climate resilience at each stage of a real asset s lifecycle. Key Questions for Building Climate Resilience DUE DILIGENCE 1. How will climate change and severe weather affect the asset 2. How resilient is the surrounding community and or infrastructure DESIGN 1. How will the design influence the resilience of the asset to acute and long term risks 2. How do resilience upgrades or credentials impact the cost of my insurance premiums or value of an asset DISRUPTION MANAGEMENT 1. In the event of an emergency with what companies government agencies and individuals does the property s management need to have established relationships agreements 2. Who has decision making authority during an emergency situation If that person is unavailable what is the chain of command DIVEST 1. How often should investors reevaluate portfolios for climate risk 2. At what point does an asset become uninsurable \n",

flood from sea level rise be a specific property coastal or inland do sit above sea level or below investor have traditionally rely on insurance to reduce exposure to risk and will continue to do so as the climate change . with the insurance industry face increasingly unsustainable climate relate loss however the old model will no longer suffice . insurance model will need to assess risk in a change climate and investor can work with insurer to find the way forward see the role of insurance . figure 5 project change in 100 year storm intensity % source u.s. epa creat climate scenarios

be the local community infrastructure and government to respond to disaster what be the likelihood of people ecosystem economic sector supply chain or local business to suffer adverse effect from climate relate physical hazard and how might these affect real asset investment at a national level macroeconomic capacity can make investment in real asset less risky . for example country with a high literacy rate well institution high per capita income high degree of openness to trade and high level of government spending be better able to withstand and recover from natural disasters.19 similarly abundance of financial capital in the form of deep domestic credit market and foreign exchange resource can speed recovery . at the city level investor can look to collaboration and analysis of resilience for guidance . for example the rockefeller foundation s 100 resilient cities program act as a clearinghouse for good practice in urban resilience work with mayor s office of 100 city worldwide . participate city commit to address a range of social and environmental challenge those commit to address climate change reflect a global network include london santiago and los angeles.20 resilience analysis such as the resilience capacity index see a balancing act consider the way that socioeconomic and environmental factor come together to promote resilience . as resilience relate to a specific asset which characteristic make vulnerable in an extreme event to answer this question investor evaluate every relevant aspect of investment . when be the asset build and with what material what type of tenant and use occupy the space do the property have storm window and drain in place if the location be flood prone be the electrical equipment in the basement which would make vulnerable to damage and long disruption or on the rooftop such detail can make a significant difference to damage and cost from a weather or climate event . for example a mixed use project in boston that incorporated resilience feature include elevated mechanical system seawall and saltwater tolerant landscaping find 2 to 18 percent high rent and reduce actuarial flood loss expectancy by 90 percent.21 by ascertain the extent to which an asset be prepare for a change climate investor can make informed decision on whether current or future investment be sound . the role of insurance in managing climate risk real asset investor rely on insurance to help mitigate climate relate risk . pay insurance premium to enable rebuild after extreme weather event for example enable investor to support otherwise attractive property market in region with high climate risk exposure . however today s insurance model be become outdate and unsustainable as climate risk intensify and the cost of loss grow . the $ 330 billion in global natural catastrophe insure and uninsured loss in 2017 be the second high annual total to date after $ 354 billion in 2011 while the total insure loss set a new record at $ 135 billion.22 give that historical datum may not accurately benchmark future risk pricing climate risk into property insurance premium be difficult and pose a challenge to current insurance practice . the implication be twofold climate risk today may be underprice by insurance market and as model begin to price climate risk more accurately premium may rise and in some case asset may become uninsurable . the united nations environment programme unep finance initiative establish the principles for sustainable insurance in 2012 to develop a common framework for the industry to address environmental social and governance opportunity include the risk of climate change . guide insurer to embed environmental criterion into decision make across business include in risk management and underwriting process which in time will necessitate a more direct approach to price climate risk . more than 83 organization have adopt the principles which represent more than 20 percent of global insurance premiums.23 investor can play an active role in how all this unfold by work with insurer to bolster the resilience of real estate and infrastructure to prevent jump in premium and to preserve the long term insurability of most at risk asset . some insurer be now develop rating system for real estate and infrastructure around asset exposure and vulnerability to severe weather event and other climate relate hazards.24 by apply a rating approach insurer would foster good practice in term of building design and preparedness by real asset owner bring benefit to investor and community . insurer could also offer the ability to insure a set of asset as a geographically diversified portfolio rather than at the single asset level enable a more diversified approach to manage climate risk . to help keep premium down and incentivize climate resilience improvement real asset investor can also press insurer for multi year insurance contract that reflect commitment . the chief research officer of insurance brokerage rms have signal that insurer would be prepared to invest in risk reduction if know someone guarantee to stay insure with as through some multi year insurance contract . 25 by partner with the insurance industry as evolve to more effectively price the risk of climate change to real asset investor can help shape a more sustainable and resilient path forward . building climate resilience across a real asset s lifecycle once investor understand the risk to current or potential real asset investment present by climate hazard exposure and vulnerability how can act on morgan stanley real assets believe that consider resilience across an asset s lifecycle can help investor and asset manager make well decision minimize risk and capture the opportunity that climate resilient building and infrastructure will increasingly offer . figure 6 a lifecycle approach to managing climate risk due diligence the first step be for property or infrastructure investor to apply due diligence criterion to climate hazard exposure and vulnerability as would with other risk factor such as financial economic and political circumstance . due diligence in a climate context involve a three step process identify risk determine potential outcome severity and recommend action to improve the property s resilience to the identify threat . this revolve around the concept that prior to investment establish a baseline set of resilience standard should be consider . in identify risk investor should first consider market level condition include potential exposure to any and all severe weather event other geological and climate changerelate hazard and non climate relate condition that can exacerbate damage . as previously note historical baseline may not fully measure future condition so analysis should incorporate publicly available datum source such as the u.s. climate resilience toolkit . if investor green light an investment should gauge the building pipeline or facility s ability to withstand the identify threat and recover operation after suffer damage as well as ability to withstand long term change in climate system . this view of resilience can be take through the engineering lens of the four rs robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity the speed of response to disruption .26 where investor find gap or vulnerability in emergency and resilience management can take action to protect asset . due diligence support sound invest by determine the approximate cost associate with option to improve the asset s resilience to identified threat . these can be significant for seismic property retrofit for example the city of santa monica california enact program with cost to building owner estimate at up to $ 50 to $ 100 per square foot for concrete and steel building and $ 5 000 to $ 10 000 per unit for wood apartment buildings.27 careful consideration of the cost involve to enhance resilience be essential at all stage of the investment cycle especially give the expectation that climate hazard and result impact will intensify over time . design once an investment be make investor can address asset level vulnerability by implement design improvement that enhance climate resilience by address robustness and redundancy . as the risk to real asset from extreme weather and ongoing climate change become clear resilient design be a focus area for the sector with industry wide good practice and standard be adopt and develop for both new construction and for retrofit . for investor use such standard and credential can provide useful guidance in design a new asset or retrofit an exist one . credential can also offer positive brand opportunity and can bring benefit beyond those trigger if a climate event strike and resilience measure be in place . the urban land institute s ten principles for building resilience offer good practice for incorporate resilience into real asset by take a view of economic environmental and social factor together . meanwhile the national institute of building sciences have document the cost and benefit of design new building that be more robust to climate change . in a 2017 report researcher find that invest in hazard mitigation measure that exceed relevant requirement of the international code council s 2015 model building code could save $ 4 for every $ 1 spent.28 enhance robustness and redundancy require design building and renovate asset with specific hazard in mind . climate change may increase the frequency and severity of extreme temperature both hot and cold . building at risk of heatwave trigger power outage can support redundancy by upgrade back up generator capacity . orient and shade building to reduce heating and cool need or instal glaze glass operable window or super insulate building envelope can enhance energy efficiency and make a building more robust to extreme temperature . move power line below ground and upgrade insulation can protect local electricity grid during heatwave as well as storm and earthquake . water system upgrade can help prevent against cool water shortage for facility such as power plant . for asset vulnerable to impact from drought building can install drought tolerant landscaping and make use of rainwater gray water collection and reuse system . natural landscaping and rooftop garden can also help reduce cool load in region where drought be exacerbate by heat wave . to withstand flooding condition from storm surge heavy rain or rise sea level asset manager can raise mechanical equipment and backup generator above ground level to help minimize power interruption . backup power system can also keep interior air condition reduce the chance of mold or mildew develop during power interruption . landscape with native plant bioswale and raise berm can help protect against storm surge and tide and absorb stormwater runoff.30 storm surge and flooding be often accompany by high wind condition during hurricane or typhoon . storm rate wind resistant window prevent damage by withstand the stress of high wind or impact from projectile . designate refuge area or interior room can protect building occupant by provide shelter during storm . infrastructure asset be design with lifespan of several decade or more and will accordingly need to adapt to longterm change in climate system and the frequency of extreme weather event over time . for example airport runway road and rail transport in region face with intensify heatwave will likely need to be design to tolerate great heat . bridge and oil and gas pipeline may need modification to withstand more frequent flooding and support redundancy in the case of an event . flood barrier be already in use to protect london and coastline in the netherlands and be due to be implement in venice during 2018 . in the come decade such defense may also be need in u.s. eastern seaboard city such as boston and new york . communication infrastructure be of critical importance during and after an extreme weather event yet these system be vulnerable to damage . redundant system can help ensure continuity and thereby enable other community response system to mobilize quickly . for example as wireless telecommunications network can be vulnerable to damage from hurricane flooding and earthquake network can build in redundant datum center and alternative fiber ring which would allow continued operation even if the main system be disrupt . investor who keep on top of design modification and good practice for resilient infrastructure will not only protect against risk but may see the value of asset rise as demand grow for service such as continuously available electricity and air conditioning in a change climate . design credentials there be a range of credential program investor can look to for guidance on environmental design and resilience . some of the most widely recognize credential include reli in november 2017 u.s. green building council usgbc introduce a new resilient design rating system know as reli a tool for assess building and community resilience to severe weather and climate event . reli build on leed guideline pilot in 2015 which include planning for climate change and emergency designate and design for a building s top three hazard and establish design of passive survivability a property s ability to tolerate long term interruption of power heating fuel or water . peer certification usgbc also offer sustainability and resilience infrastructure credential for power network and micro grid through peer certification performance excellence in electricity renewal . global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb gresb measure real estate and infrastructure company sustainability performance include a new resilience module in 2018 . envision for infrastructure asset the institute for sustainable infrastructure offer the envision credential which include climate and risk as one of five sustainability categories.29 company be rate on factor include resiliency criterion create a climate impact assessment and adaptation plan and design measure that safeguard against natural hazard promote long term resilience and adaptive capability and avoid trap and vulnerability . designing for the future designing for resilience will also be an iterative process . as the scope and frequency of climate event change design standard and good practice will evolve . in design for today good practice consider projection for mean sea level and the likelihood of 10 year 50 year and 100 year storm in the future . these parameter however may evolve depend on how climate change impact play out in the come decade . this obviously affect new construction require investor to consider lead edge design feature and standard in order to safeguard asset against unknowable future threat . design for future use also require consideration of the way that individual and community will use infrastructure building and real asset in the future . in design system intend to last for 10 20 or 50 year climate aware investor should consider the way that system can and will change . advance in fuel source communication network and distribution system have the potential to impact how today s infrastructure investment be use in the future . how and where those investment be make can impact the ability of a community to respond to climate event both the ability to access critical resource and the speed of response . additionally both near and long term resilience measure for any real asset could be blunt if the local government s approach to manage climate risk be inadequate . this mean that investor should be evaluate not only the design of own asset but also the potential need for upgrade to surround infrastructure such as road water system sewer and electrical line . infrastructure system be often interrelate and the resilience of a single asset be dependent on the ability of the surround infrastructure to anticipate withstand and respond to adverse event . for a real asset investor the more effective and long last that municipal resilience policy be the well . disruption management the third phase in the roadmap for investor to build real asset resilience be proactive disruption management . this involve create system and process that ensure resourcefulness and rapidity as part of business continuity planning . while some disruption be inevitable during severe weather event effective real asset management consider resilience before during and after such disaster which can make a big difference to the human and economic consequence . before an event be on the radar pre establish contract term and obligation with key supplier will prove valuable in the aftermath of extreme weather event since take bid on repair or replacement after the storm drive up cost and exacerbate delay . pre positioning supply and ready a detailed list of potential contact be also important to have in place ahead of time . because road and bridge be at risk in extreme weather event key personnel could have difficulty reach the site . advance planning be helpful to prepare for such a possibility and provision to shelter in place along with backup personnel and off site duplicate hard copy record may be useful . by consider the way that resource can be access and mobilize ahead of time investor can thereby enhance the rapidity of a disaster response . in immediate recovery from severe weather event the focus should be on sustain life and then restore facility operation to full capacity . with these address design and disruption management be iteratively connected . some missed imperative in minimize disruption may be obvious while other could be uncover by thorough after the fact briefing . additional resiliency measure can then be assess and ideally put in place . div in balance resilience concern market attractiveness and cost benefit analysis investor may conclude that a potential or current asset do not meet the necessary threshold or criterion to justify an investment . where return no longer balance with risk investor or fund manager may opt to divest . such decision may be make as a result of due diligence or during ongoing assessment and review of a portfolio or an individual asset s performance . alternatively investor may choose to set gating criterion for resilience measure for an asset a market or both . investor plan for climate resilience can take lesson from other type of natural phenomenon such as seismic activity . where baseline criterion be not meet be important to evaluate the cost of necessary upgrade and if feasible make the improvement . these standard help avoid invest in real estate with lateral load resistance and other metric below pre agree criterion to withstand earthquake . give the long duration of real asset lifecycle and intensify climate hazard investor should thoughtfully consider climate risk at all stage of an investment continually make decision about design disruption management and divestment that enable to build and manage a resilient portfolio for the long term . lincoln road retail miami resilience in action every year million of tourist visit miami florida from all over the world draw to beautiful beach a booming nightlife and a rich cultural history . business be thrive as well with annual business establishment growth of 2 percent from 2010 2015 more than double the national average.31 amidst the glitz and glamour s easy to forget that miami be one of the united states most at risk city in the face of climate change . miami s overall cost to coastal property from sea level rise through 2100 be model at roughly $ 80 billion the second high in the united states after tampa.32 at the heart of south beach sit lincoln road a popular shopping and tourism district . across all phase of the investment lifecycle be important to consider climate risk and put system in place to increase the property s resilience to climate change . due diligence due diligence research and analysis identify sea level rise and hurricane as potential threat to lincoln road but also take into account the potential return of own and operate a retail property in one of the united states most popular market for dining and entertainment . in the end investor might determine the benefit of invest in the property outweigh the risk and focus on design and manage the building with resilience in mind . design the retail building at lincoln road include robust design feature like impact window and raise grading to withstand heavy wind and debris as well as flooding . mechanical equipment be raise above ground level to prevent water damage . the city have exist plan to upgrade stormwater drain to mitigate flooding . during severe storm flood panel can be use to help prevent damage to facility and to tenant merchandise . disruption management perhaps most important be the system in place at lincoln road that ensure resourcefulness and rapidity in the event of an emergency . emergency response plan be preestablishe with clear line of authority for decision making and spending . duplicate copy of emergency plan be store offsite in the event that the facility can not be access or electronic system be down . on site critical resource and supply include emergency contact list be store in easily and safely accessible location on upper floor enable personnel to carry out response plan uninterrupted . shelter in place protocol be establish as well to ensure that anyone leave on site can remain safe during a storm and after in the event that road or bridge be inaccessible . the site manager have pre establish contract in place with key supplier to repair and replace building or equipment quickly and cost effectively . facility staff help carry out emergency plan be hire on a contract basis so additional support can be bring in as need . in short while lincoln road may be expose and vulnerable to climate related hazard such as hurricane careful planning across the investment lifecycle mean assess climate risk establish a resilience strategy and help protect the site against physical and safety risk in the event of an emergency . conclusion this brief highlight the necessity for real asset investor to evaluate and act on climate risk to safeguard investment . also showcase the financial and reputational opportunity that resilient property and infrastructure can offer . as population continue to urbanize real asset value will become ever more concentrated in urban center which in turn will become the frontline for climate resilience and adaptation . by conduct due diligence pursue design that prepare for a climate change world and work with insurer municipal authority and other stakeholder to promote resilience investor can play an important role in this evolution . below suggest actionable question that can serve as a starting point for assess and building climate resilience at each stage of a real asset s lifecycle . key questions for building climate resilience due diligence 1 . how will climate change and severe weather affect the asset 2 . how resilient be the surround community and or infrastructure design 1 . how will the design influence the resilience of the asset to acute and long term risk 2 . how do resilience upgrade or credential impact the cost of insurance premium or value of an asset disruption management 1 . in the event of an emergency with what company government agency and individual do the property s management need to have establish relationship agreement 2 . who have decision make authority during an emergency situation if that person be unavailable what be the chain of command divest 1 . how often should investor reevaluate portfolio for climate risk 2 . at what point do an asset become uninsurable\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  2018 was another busy year in mergers and acquisitions M A with advised deal volume hitting $3.35 trillion the highest level since 2015.1 We generally prefer our growth to be organic so news of M A sets our capital allocation alarm bells ringing. Companies do not always see it that way however and we regularly find ourselves having to assess the merits or otherwise of acquisitions. The starting point of this analysis is that most M A is value destructive. The market evaluates M A on whether the transaction is accretive to earnings per share EPS . In a near zero interest rate environment practically every acquisition should be accretive. Nevertheless some acquirers still have to refer to the most damaging of epithets strategic which basically means they could not make the numbers stack up even though debt is available almost for free. Our approach to M A does not take much note of whether something is accretive but we instead consider scale skill price and most importantly the sustainability of returns. As we go on to describe while there are companies that are successful in M A many aren t. Most M A is value destructive but some smaller roll up acquisitions by serial acquirers can be value creating. Size matters. If a company decides to engage in M A activity we much prefer carefully targeted acquisitions to blundering grabs. Acquisitions in quality land are typically expensive and hence the acquirers may put out over optimistic targets for cost and revenue synergies to justify the price paid for the acquisition. Once it has become clear that the initial expectations were too aggressive management may still cling to their initial over optimistic targets. This means they can do the wrong thing for the long term health of the business such as cut deep into R D or sales and marketing. Even absent this the resulting leverage can make the acquirer s share price more vulnerable to the occasional shifts in operational trends. We tend to be cautious of large acquisitions. For example in 2018 we exited a specialist ingredients manufacturer due to an acquisition of a company we felt was too large and created too much leverage and reduced our position in a tobacco company due to its acquisition of a competitor that increased leverage. However some smaller roll up acquisitions by serial acquirers can be value creating. In our experience there are companies that have built successful business models around acquisitions a Canadian based leading supplier of software and services is a good example of this. These companies tend to be de centralised organisations that integrate small to medium sized companies into their network offering access to some shared services like procurement logistics general management or sales. This model works well as the integration process is simple and straightforward. Most importantly it appeals to the founder entrepreneur who often accepts a lower sale price for the ability to stay on as a general manager to help their business evolve and keep skin in the game. Some acquirers have the ability to truly enhance their acquisition thanks to superior skills. One such example is a French personal care company which typically buys small affordable brands at a rate of two to six deals per year spending around 2 billion or 2% of enterprise value a year. Over time this company has developed some of these brands into sizeable operations. For example a small American cosmetics company which originally began as an apothecary in New York s East Village and was bought in 2000 for $100 $150 million exceeded 1 billion in sales by 2017. At the heart of this success was giving this much smaller company access to a world class global platform while preserving its distinctive brand identity. Price is also an important consideration. This is a particularly difficult issue for quality companies to navigate. Given the relative stability and resilience of the businesses there is rarely an opportunity to buy a company materially below its intrinsic value especially not once the premium is added. Hence the return on invested capital pre synergies can be unappealing and often below the cost of capital. Generating cost synergies without cutting into the muscle is a capability only few players possess which is why we are sceptical of most of these cost driven acquisitions. We can accept a full pre synergy price if we are seeing credible medium term growth resulting from improvement in product innovation marketing or management but this requires confidence in the acquirer as an operator. Equally when an acquisition creates higher utilisation of key capabilities like the sales platform or opens up new growth paths traits we have seen in the pharmaceutical and med tech industries we remain supportive. However this is all provided we have confidence in the acquirer s operational capabilities leverage is controlled and price is not egregious. Regular engagement with companies is a way we can assess if their attitudes to M A align with our own. Regular engagement with companies is a way we can assess their attitudes to M A and try to ensure they align with our own. Granted high quality operators with capable management should be able to generate long term value from M A. But this requires strong governance and clarity that any acquisitions will not have a negative material impact on the sustainability of long term returns on capital. As a team we have been engaging with companies on matters of governance for over 20 years and we are more than willing to actively engage when we believe proposed acquisitions will have a deleterious effect. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  We believe the next decade is unlikely to mirror the last. We witnessed the second longest bull run in history with the S P 500 index rising 17.9% annually since March 2009 as illustrated in Display 1 . In our view predicting the exact timing of the next downturn is impossible but building a portfolio that seeks to withstand it is essential. We believe that this preparation requires applying a multidimensional investment methodology and discarding conventional wisdom. DISPLAY 1 S P 500 Index Total Return Source Bloomberg S P 500 Index Total Return Index Gross Dividends . Past performance is not indicative of future results. While historically defensive sectors such as utilities healthcare and consumer staples have long been considered safe areas to invest and cyclical sectors have been perceived to have higher risk we believe painting broad brush strokes about sectors and cyclicality is ineffective as a guideline for constructing a resilient portfolio. Rather we believe that deep evaluation of company fundamentals alongside a clear understanding of industry forces is critical to the success of creating a portfolio that seeks to withstand the next market downturn. Since the inception of AIP Private Markets in 2000 the team has collectively committed $18.0 billion to over 800 private equity transactions.1 Through this experience we formed an investment philosophy that we believe helps enable us to endure challenging environments and to thrive in robust market conditions. Therefore with a forward looking lens we developed a three pronged framework for seeking to select resilient companies with strong value creation prospects that entails the following 1. Identifying efficiency producing businesses with exposure to stable end markets One of the challenges to investing resiliently is to identify businesses that will grow in both benign and challenging market conditions. One such niche that we believe has this characteristic includes companies that provide a solution or service that lowers the overall costs for customers and therefore improves margins. Such offerings can be the result of minor or major technological advances or services that better fit the current needs of customers often solving problems that did not exist 10 15 years ago. Businesses that focus on producing such efficiency can consistently do well through market cycles as they improve the profitability of their customers agnostic of where in the market cycle they are implemented. For example we invested in the largest private label oral care manufacturer in the United States. Since the global financial crisis retailers have experienced declining footfall and in some cases declining revenues. In response many retailers materially increased their promotion of private label brands which are typically cheaper for end consumers and could be 3x as profitable as branded goods.2 As a consequence consumption of private label brands has risen. The private label oral care manufacturer that we invested in is a significant player in this space and in our opinion is the chief beneficiary of this trend. As a result this business has been able to grow even in a period where revenues for retailers are broadly under pressure.3 In a similar contrarian vein we acquired a medical scribe company that serves medical providers including both hospitals and outpatient physicians. Our internal view is that healthcare providers will face both revenue and cost pressures going forward due to the U.S. government s desire to control overall healthcare spending and a continued shortage of both doctors and nurses. However this company provides material efficiencies to these providers by solving issues related to the recently implemented electronic medical record systems EMR . This business provides qualified medical scribes that complete the EMR notes. This company has grown revenues organically at a rate of nearly 30%4 and we believe that its growth can continue even in more challenging environments for medical providers due to the cost savings the company provides.5 2. Partnering with highly aligned and specialized investment partners In our view assessing resiliency involves dissecting the experience base of owner operators and the payouts they receive from their compensation plans in both up and down markets. We seek to align ourselves with highly specialized private equity sponsors and management teams with proven track records of executing value creation plans and navigating operational challenges in the specific industry they invest in. We seek to achieve a strong alignment of interests with our partners by investing in businesses where the current sponsor manager of the asset believes in its go forward value creation potential and their compensation structure encourages both capital preservation and generation of strong returns for investors. By way of illustration we invested in one of the leading healthcare providers of respiratory products. The company operates in a highly fragmented subsector ripe for industry consolidation. The value creation thesis going forward was predicated upon pursuing a consolidation strategy. Such a buy and build strategy in our view requires an experienced team that can identify and execute add ons successfully. In the case of this company the management is led by a CEO with 27 years of experience in this particular healthcare niche who had already completed over 60 accretive tuck ins since 2006. The private equity sponsor is purely focused on growth oriented companies in the healthcare sector and brought deep and complementary experience in the segment to this investment. The sponsor who was the current owner of the asset believed in the trajectory of the asset and they agreed to roll all proceeds generated from the profit share during their prior ownership alongside us in this transaction and to make a meaningful additional commitment to the investment from their personal balance sheets. Through this alignment mechanism we sought to ensure our partners were incentivized to both preserve capital and produce positive investment returns.6 As another example we purchased a platform of franchise boutique fitness brands in 2018. The CEO has a demonstrated track record of scaling fitness businesses even through the global financial crisis. Confident in the value creation potential going forward he rolled over his entire stake in the business to this transaction. Additionally the option pool was increased for the management team and structured with performance hurdles. The private equity sponsor in this transaction is a highly regarded growth investor that has focused on the boutique fitness space over the last eleven years. This sponsor also made a considerable investment alongside us. This degree of alignment is representative of what we seek in our partners levels of commitment to the companies and their conviction around the growth prospects.7 3. Seeking value on the buy with businesses exhibiting high cash flow generation and conservative leverage Investors architecting for resilience we believe are almost certainly concerned with the peak absolute pricing levels paid for assets in the current market but many may forget that further fragility is added when we consider the impact of leverage. With average valuations hovering around 10.5x in the U.S. private equity market and 12.9x in the public equity market as illustrated in Display 2 the environment continues to be challenging for investors seeking high quality companies at attractive prices. Nevertheless we remain disciplined in seeking to purchase assets at discounts to fair market value and with strong relative value. The average discount to fair market value and entry multiple across the investments we closed in 2018 are 16% and 8.1x EBITDA respectively.8 We believe that the key to accessing value in frothy markets is to take a proactive approach to deal sourcing. Through our relationship driven sourcing efforts we seek to generate proprietary deal flow that allows us to invest in high quality companies at reasonable purchase prices. However in our view an attractive purchase price provides only limited protection in a downturn if the company is over levered. Although current leverage multiples have surpassed pre crisis levels we maintain our focus on conservative capital structures. The average debt EBITDA ratio for our investments made in 2018 is 1.9x EBITDA9 versus market leverage of 5.8x EBITDA.10 In addition to leverage we also assess a company s cash flow characteristics to seek to determine how stable recurring or sensitive they are to cyclical fluctuations. We seek to acquire highly cash flow generative businesses that continue to provide value to equity investors through downturns. DISPLAY 2 Leverage and Pricing Multiples Source S P LCD Leveraged Buyout Review 3Q18 S P Capital IQ. Debt EBITDA A measurement of leverage calculated as a company s interest bearing liabilities minus cash or cash equivalents divided by its earnings before deduction of interest tax and amortization EBITDA . EV EBITDA Compares the enterprise value EV of a business defined as the market capitalization plus debt minority interest and preferred shares minus cash and cash equivalents to EBITDA. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Conclusion There are many strategies to look at when building a resilient portfolio. Our experience has led us to develop a framework for selecting companies and constructing a portfolio that seeks to withstand changes in the economic cycle. They should be well capitalized led by strong management teams and fall within pockets of growth in less cyclical industries. We believe this guiding philosophy can enable a portfolio to perform well in both economic booms and recessions. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  When creating solutions for our fixed income clients that integrate environmental social and governance ESG factors there is no one size fits all approach. ESG goals vary by end investor. However there is one question we are asked regularly Can I incorporate ESG into my portfolio without giving up yield We believe the answer is a resounding yes. ESG considerations have always been implicit in our credit investment analysis. Given the asymmetric nature of price moves in fixed income 1 minimising defaults is crucial and we find that more responsible companies tend to have fewer defaults. We believe that ESG factors have the ability to impact the fundamental credit risk of a company and in turn a company s bond price. Controversies and negative ESG related headlines can hinder investors ability to transact in a bond over the short term. However ESG research is not typically designed for fixed income investors. As a result the MSIM Fixed Income team has created a proprietary ESG scoring methodology that explicitly considers the risks and opportunities ESG factors pose to corporate bonds. Although fixed income investors are slightly behind equity investors in recognizing how ESG factors can provide unique insights into long term risks and opportunities as we see in Display 1 there is no shortage of examples where a sector related ESG factor has led to sharp downward bond price movements restructuring or default ENVIRONMENTAL Litigation and fines resulting from environmental disasters in the energy space SOCIAL Business model disruptions as a result of additional regulation to better protect the vulnerable in consumer finance GOVERNANCE Excessive financial engineering partially as a result of poor governance in the construction sector We aim to capture the potential for these risks in our proprietary sector risk analysis MSIM ESG Credit Scoring Analysis Display 2 . Display 1 Examples of Company ESG Incidents Source Bloomberg. Each row of data represents one company as an example that experienced the ESG incident described. The bond price before and following the incident represents one individual bond that was issued by the respective company taken at the peak bond price right before the incident was made public and at the trough bond price following the incident. For illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as how each security have moved or will move before and after an incident. Proprietary Sector Risk Analysis Built on their deep knowledge as sector specialists our credit analysts complement their investment experience with ESG focused research from a wide array of leading third party sources to derive sector risk weightings of high medium or low across 47 sub sectors. As seen in Display 3 these risk weightings reflect our view of how likely the ESG factor is to have a negative effect on a bond s price movement. Combined With Third Party Company ESG Data We use this sector risk analysis to assign weights to raw ESG data provided by leading third party experts. Risk weightings will vary from low to high for environmental and social factors but will always be high for governance. We find that governance is the strongest ESG driver of portfolio risk and return and as fixed income investors we rely heavily on management teams controls to avoid involvement in fraud or corruption and to execute on commitments to repay debt. Adjustment 1 Momentum While we offer our clients the option of using negative screening and sector exclusion lists for segregated mandates our view is that companies should be rewarded for demonstrating a willingness to change and adopt stronger ESG principles. Sustainability experts have recently raised questions about the effectiveness of negative screens preferring instead a more holistic view of a company s approach. To account for momentum in our scoring methodology we make numerical adjustments to third party data in favour of companies that demonstrate positive ESG momentum and against companies that demonstrate negative momentum. Adjustment 2 Controversy Negative ESG related headlines can impact our ability to transact in a company s bonds. Not only can a company s controversy change its credit fundamentals but it tends to increase public focus on ESG topics. Portfolio managers may move to avoid the most obviously controversial names. To account for controversy we make a numerical adjustment against companies that have been featured in the headlines for negative reasons. Our adjustment for controversy has less impact than our adjustment for momentum in our final score we prefer to bias our score towards the future rather than the past. Display 2 MSIM s ESG Credit Scoring Analysis Display 3 Sector Risk Factor Weightings For illustrative purposes only. This represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions. MSIM ESG Credit Scoring Analysis The final output is a numerical score that is comparable across sectors and used as one of many inputs into the final investment decision on a security by security basis. We also use these scores to calculate the weighted average MSIM ESG Credit Scoring Analysis of a portfolio and its corresponding benchmark. We use this score to better understand the ESG quality of our portfolios. In Display 4 we demonstrate how our ESG Credit Score can differ from third party ratings. In this example we compare two U.S. retail companies which for simplicity we will refer to as Retailer A and Retailer B. As you can see using MSCI data the companies appear to have similar ESG risk profiles. However when we look a bit deeper we notice several factors that we believe differentiate the credits impacting their ESG risks and possibly their bond prices in the future. First we have already discussed the importance of explicitly considering momentum and controversy factors. In this example Retailer A and Retailer B couldn t be more different. Retailer A has been involved in some significant controversies and has had downward ESG ratings momentum. Retailer B has been involved in fewer material controversies and more importantly has demonstrated positive ESG momentum. When we look at the two companies quantitative E S and G scores we see that the environmental and social scores of these companies are similar but the governance ratings are quite far apart. As we see governance being the ESG risk that most drives credit performance it becomes imperative in our model to differentiate between Retailer A and Retailer B. Taken in aggregate our MSIM ESG Credit Score model incorporates the divergent momentum controversy and governance scores to come up with a proprietary ESG Credit Score that is not only more applicable to fixed income investors but we believe also properly differentiates these two credits. Display 4 Case Study Retailer A vs. Retailer B Source Morgan Stanley Investment Management MSCI. June 2018. Information is subject to change and provided for illustrative purposes only. Scale 1 10 0 worse 10 best. This represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions. Our Continued Focus on ESG The Fixed Income ESG Strategy team continually re evaluates our methodology and data inputs based on the latest research and studies available. We plan to continue empirical work to refine our ESG weights and scoring methodology over time. Our objective is to approach ESG in a thoughtful and practical way rather than as a box ticking exercise. By embedding ESG within the core investment team and process we aim to optimise a portfolio s ESG profile in a way that not only minimises any yield discount but turns ESG considerations into insights that can help mitigate risk and contribute to higher potential returns. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  We think it makes sense to manage euro fixed income portfolios on an aggregated basis i.e. with all the sectors in a single portfolio. This is because the eurozone has experienced periods of systemic stress which have affected all fixed income assets and may well re occur. In such periods when the correlation between asset returns either moves toward 1 or 1 it makes sense for one portfolio manager to have control of the whole portfolio to ensure different sectors are not all overweight of the same risk factor and also to optimise off setting hedge positions. Why the trend to disaggregation makes sense... The trend in fixed income mandates in recent years has been towards management disaggregation. Rather than instruct a portfolio manager to manage a mixed portfolio of assets credit securitised government bonds etc. end investors have allocated individual mandates to single sector specialists e.g. appoint a government bond fund manager to manage the sovereign portion of the portfolio. The logic for this is clear the end investor can access best in class investment skill in each asset class. They can also optimise the diversification1 benefits by setting an asset allocation across sectors which best matches his investment goals rather than using the market cap weighting of an aggregate index. and why it doesn t in euro fixed income However we believe there is a compelling argument for aggregation rather than disaggregation when it comes to managing euro fixed income assets. This is because aggregation provides a better way to manage the risks stemming from the systemic crises which have periodically affected euro fixed income markets. The nature of a systemic crisis is that it affects the performance of all assets sometimes in ways which investors would not have previously expected. To make things more difficult eurozone crises have varied in their length nature and intensity depending on whether the problem stemmed from a global financial crisis e.g. 2008 a domestic banking crisis which contaminated the sovereign and rest of the economy e.g. Ireland and Spain in 2010 or a political crisis which affected the sovereign and the banking system as well as other countries e.g. Greece in 2010 and 2015 . Systemic risk events argue for aggregate portfolios In such an environment we believe it is advantageous to have a single investment manager who is aware of all the risks in a portfolio and is better placed to manage the overall risk holistically. A particular risk of disaggregation is that investment managers operating independently of each other may implement similar and correlated risk positions in their portfolios which amplify overall portfolio risk. Similarly working independently of each other they are unlikely to maximise the internal hedges which exist within a multi asset fixed income portfolio. Judged primarily on their own individual performance they have limited incentive to help the overall aggregated portfolio achieve better risk adjusted returns. For example imagine a situation in which the macroeconomic fundamentals for country A were improving. In a disaggregated portfolio the managersof the corporate credit sovereign and the securitised portfolios may all look to overweight country A. However collectively this might lead to an imprudently large exposure. The manager of an aggregate fund would be better placed to judge if the overall exposure was appropriate as well as the best way to gain that exposure e.g. through financials or the sovereign debt. In addition he may be able to engineer a better potential return on a risk adjusted basis by owning a larger allocation of low risk government bonds to offset the high yielding risky positions. He may not expect the government bonds to do very well but thinks they are worth owning to help mitigate risk in case things turn out worse than expected and the risky positions do badly. In a disaggregated portfolio individual managers are not aware nor incentivised to hedge each other s risk positions in this way. Disaggregation may also slow the optimal re allocation of assets between asset classes as opportunities and threats emerge. It can be time consuming to redeem investments re allocate them and redesign mandates if they turned out to be inappropriate. Many euro fixed income assets have experienced several unanticipated periods of stress over the last 20 years and may not have performed as initially anticipated. For example the usual benchmark for euro sovereign portfolios prior to 2010 was a market cap weighted index of euro sovereign bonds. This was generally expected to be the safe haven component of a portfolio delivering modest returns but performing well during periods of economic and financial stress. Few investors foresaw that from 2010 to 2013 one issuer making up around 10% of the index i.e. Greece would default others Portugal and Cyprus would lose their investment grade rating some of the initially AAA rated sovereigns Spain and Ireland would require bailouts and the largest member of the index Italy would become the most volatile euro fixed income asset.2 Let s explain and illustrate these points with reference to the historical data for euro fixed income assets since the beginning of monetary union in 1999. Whilst past returns may not be a good reflection of future returns they do highlight some of the risks investors have experienced in the past and may therefore face in the future. DISPLAY 1 OAS spreads for main euro fixed income sectors The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. Source Bloomberg. A brief history of euro fixed income markets Display 1 shows the option adjusted spread OAS for the major sectors of the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate index i.e. Euro Treasuries government related securitised and corporate credit. It provides us with a history of the euro fixed income markets and the relative performance of the main sectors. In particular the period from 1999 until 2007 was characterised by very tight and stable credit spreads in most products the only exception being when some corporate sectors e.g. telecoms came under pressure following the dotcom bust. The first major crisis started in 2008 as the global financial crisis caused distress in euro credit markets in particular for financials. Significant stress was also experienced in securitised markets given their connection to the financial sector forcing the European Central Bank ECB to launch the first covered bond purchase programme. Sovereign debt in countries with impaired financial sectors Belgium Holland Austria also cheapened as investors saw the financial sector s problems as contingent liabilities of the state. Credit spreads tightened sharply in 2009 as the global economy recovered and the crisis faded but then widened out again from 2010 until 2013. This time the problem was more to do with the sovereign sector in particular Greece although in other countries e.g. Spain and Ireland the problem started in the banking sector and spread to the sovereign. As stresses built up within the economy and financial system other countries e.g. Italy Portugal and to a lesser degree France were also pulled into the crisis as it exposed their vulnerabilities. Issuers deemed as safe havens primarily the German sovereign experienced additional demand. A combination of central bank emergency measures and fiscal support helped end the crisis leading to a period of sustained spread compression from 2013 onwards apart from some corporate credit spread widening in 2016 and 2018 due to economic growth concerns and wider sovereign spreads in 2018 due to heightened political risks in Italy . We learn several things from this history CRISES AFFECT ALL SECTORS a systemic crisis by definition affects everything in the system. It s unsurprising that the OAS spread for the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate index was highly correlated with the ECB s Systemic Stress Indicator see Display 2 . The severity may vary depending on how severe the crisis is but finding good hiding places can be hard during these periods. Even sectors which one would have thought have few fundamental links to each other turned out to be highly correlated. For example the credit spreads of government owned or sponsored agencies which generally have very high and stable credit ratings versus sovereigns were very highly correlated to corporate credit spreads see Display 3 . NO TWO CRISES ARE THE SAME depending on why the crisis started and also because investors and regulators respond to past crises asset performance varies from crisis to crisis e.g. 2008 was primarily about financials while 2010 12 was about sovereigns especially the periphery. This means the beta i.e. the relative volatility of different assets varies over time. The correlation between assets also varies over time both depending on how each crisis builds and recedes and which assets it affects most. DIVERGENCES IN PERFORMANCE PROVIDE DIVERSIFICATION OPPORTUNITIES the silver lining to a systemic crisis is that safe haven assets can mitigate downside risks in a range of risky assets. In particular AAA rated sovereigns like Germany have performed very well in periods of stress. While the correlation between risky sectors in a crisis has risen the correlation with Bunds has become more negative see Display 4 providing a portfolio diversification opportunity at least for those who have been able to invest in both high quality government bonds and spread product. NOT ALL ASSETS PERFORM AS EXPECTED the 2008 crisis is remembered for how many structured credit products had far higher default risk than their credit rating would have suggested. In the 2010 12 euro sovereign crisis investors discovered large portions of their sovereign bond portfolios which were previously thought to have little or no default risk were actually very risky both in terms of credit spread volatility and actual default with Greece restructuring its debt in 2012 . While the Treasury OAS spread is far less volatile than other spreads this hides significant variation within the sovereign universe. Italian Treasury OAS spreads are currently wider and more volatile than any other sector of the index.

Why we fear further systemic crises Unfortunately we believe that the eurozone may face further periods of systemic stress. Many of the structural and fiscal imbalances which have caused problems in the past have not been fully resolved and while backstop and support mechanisms are better than they have been in the past they are not strong enough to make investors feel entirely confident. Highly indebted sovereigns with low trend growth economies most notably Italy remain a key source of concern for investors especially given the Greek experience made it clear that euro sovereign debt is not default risk free. Another source of concern is the continued link between sovereigns and the banking sector a potential source of contagion which runs in both directions. While the European Union EU has worked hard to reduce risk in the financial sector more substantial measures like a eurozone wide deposit guarantee system have yet to be achieved. These lessons lead us to believe that it is better for euro fixed income portfolios to be actively managed on a holistic basis i.e. with the potential performance and correlation of all assets taken into account. Risk Considerations Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The correlation between U.S. and Emerging Markets EM tech sector returns has been rising strongly for three years. As a result imbalances in EM market returns have reached extreme levels. Broken down by sector tech has contributed around 40% of EM returns over the past three years a share matched only by energy in 2007.1 In the past when the country and sector leaders in MSCI EM accounted for anywhere close to this large a share of returns it signaled a return to a more normal balance and a change in leaders. The infatuation with big tech stocks has driven the relative performance of small and medium caps on an equal weighted index to nearly two standard deviations below its historical trend in the emerging markets as shown in Display 1. This is highly unusual. EM small and medium caps have never fallen this far in the 20 year history of the equal weighted index and came close only once during the rage for large U.S. tech stocks in 2000. In the United States by the same measure the relative performance of small and medium caps has fallen by two standard deviations only three times in the last 100 years during the Great Depression the Nifty Fifty Bubble of the 1970s and the tech bubble of the late 1990s.2 In all these past cases small and medium caps started to outperform when mega caps began to falter or even before. Display 1 MSCI Emerging Markets Equal Weight Index Cap Weighted Index Data as of November 28 2018. Source MSIM Bloomberg Factset Haver. Our argument for some time has been that when market imbalances grow this extreme they don t persist as a rule. Now that we have begun to see major falls in tech and the tech heavy MSCI China index the question is how the rebalancing is likely to play out. After the busts of 2000 and 2008 beaten down sectors recovered small and medium caps came back to life and forgotten countries were rediscovered. Over the past few years investors became so focused on the tech heavy Asian markets they appeared to ignore the fundamentals of economic growth. Beginning with the launch of the MSCI EM index in 1988 the best returns had come in the fastest growing economies. But after 2016 economies with the highest growth rates underperformed the MSCI EM index and those with the lowest growth rates outperformed. Many of the outperformers were tech heavy. Even after the recent declines markets are still valuing big tech companies more highly than entire clusters of major emerging economies. After becoming the first $1 trillion company Apple is down under $900 billion but still in the same range as Indonesia and Malaysia combined and nearly three times more than Poland.3 The last time we saw companies overshadow countries this way was in Asia after the crisis of 1998 when for example GE was valued more highly than the crisis hit economies of Russia Malaysia and South Korea combined. The big difference this time many of the battered countries face no crisis and are growing rapidly. Now some of them are starting to come back. As investors sell out of tech they are rediscovering some overlooked markets of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Those markets had been battered in part by the strong dollar which always sucks money out of EM but may not last this time. Since the early 1980s the dollar has rarely traded more than 15% above or below its long term range and it is now at the high end of that range.4 Dollar bear markets have tended to last around seven years. Our view is that the dollar s rise in 2018 is a temporary rally within the downtrend that began in early 2016 and could prove long lasting. Some of the hardest hit EM currencies have stabilized and we see no reason to expect the broad collapse to resume. As a group emerging markets have strong external balances. Current account deficits are low on average having fallen significantly since the taper tantrum of 2013 rattled countries like Brazil and India. Though many analysts are worried about emerging market debt this risk is a threat mainly to China. While the rest of EM has seen its nonfinancial debt climb by 20 percentage points as a share of GDP since the global financial crisis of 2008 China s debt has grown by more than 100 percentage points.5 Tellingly the China market too had been driven largely by tech stocks until the recent correction. The question then is how to think about emerging markets as an asset class as the mania for tech passes Go back to the fundamentals that have driven markets over time. Our rules of the road zero in on the 10 most important factors for identifying countries likely to post high or accelerating growth and thus most likely to outperform the markets over the next three to five years. Right now some of the most beaten down markets are in promising economies such as Poland Indonesia the Philippines and even Mexico. One of our most important rules says that a cheap currency is a good sign and this is particularly so for countries that have seen currencies plummet this year even though they face no threat of crisis. Analysts who worry about Mexico s new leftist president Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador overlook the fact that his impact was priced into the peso even before his July election victory. By our composite measure the Mexican peso is currently the cheapest currency in the world.6 EM stocks now look relatively cheap based on price to book compared to Developed Market DM stocks on average and historically cheap in some cases. In dollar terms Mexico s market is now near a two decade low. Poland with its beaten down zloty is near a 25 year low. Both suffer mainly from the lack of major tech stocks in their index. Looked at more broadly the entire EM class was in some sense overlooked even before this year s drawdown. As of last December only about 4 6% of global equity investments were allocated to emerging markets a share that is too low based on any of the three standard approaches to asset allocation. Basing investments on the EM weight in global equity markets would imply an allocation of 12% 7 using the EM share of global GDP would imply an allocation of at least 15% and using an optimal portfolio approach would suggest an allocation of 30%.8 The upshot is that we believe many emerging markets look like compelling long term buys. Many of the beaten down countries are well insulated from crisis and are caught in an anti bubble gasping in a vacuum of attention because even now investors are focused on tech and tech heavy markets like MSCI China. As a sense of normalcy returns to markets other sectors and countries are likely to pick up momentum. While trying to time markets is a fool s game the time to make long term investments is in periods like the current one when stock prices in many high growth emerging markets appear to be cheap for no good reason. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Fixed income had a mixed month. Government bonds both developed and local currency emerging saw yields rise which is not a surprising development after their strong rally in March. However credit oriented bonds investment grade high yield and external emerging market had a strong month with yields falling and spreads tightening. What s behind this Economic data turned out better than expected with a particular emphasis on an improvement in China and the U.S. suggesting the global slowdown that was so evident in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of this year was coming to an end. U.S. first quarter gross domestic product GDP turned out much stronger than expected although some of the growth was borrowing from the second quarter in terms of inventory buildup. Central banks continued to play their supportive role by not doing anything to suggest policy would not be supportive in the quarters ahead. With the U.S. economy back in a not too hot not too cold mold the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed on hold other G10 central banks in a bias to ease mode and Chinese growth bottoming the outlook for risky assets looks reasonable. Valuations in most developed government bond markets look a bit stretched with at the margin a bit more upside than downside yield potential reflecting a market bias for easier monetary policy which may not materialize. In any event with most economies and policies looking to be on a fairly even keel we should expect volatility to stay low and risky assets high yield emerging markets to be well supported at least outside of idiosyncratic factors specific to those companies or countries. In other words the risks of economic weakness are diminished but not enough to get central banks to worry about too strong growth. And the beat goes on if only those pesky trade issues would go away Display 1 Asset Performance Year To Date Note USD based performance. Source Thomson Reuters Datastream. Data as of April 30 2019.

Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of April 30 2019. Fixed Income Outlook Data releases policy adjustments and policy pronouncements all point in the direction of continuity economic recovery stable low inflation stable to easy monetary policy. We believe the biggest challenge to continued good performance of corporate and securitized credit and emerging market debt is valuation. The markets cannot keep rallying at the pace we have seen so far this year. Our strategy has been to look for opportunities to reduce exposures where we think assets have become fully valued and rotate into markets sectors companies where there is still upside potential. For example in countries like Australia and New Zealand there is still a reasonable probability central banks will cut rates this year. This is in contrast to the situation in the U.S. Canada and the eurozone where probabilities of rate cuts are much lower. As a result we think holding above average interest rate risk in the Antipodean countries as being more attractive than holding it in the U.S. We think relative opportunities such as these are a better way to position portfolios than in taking a lot of outright interest rate risk. That said our argument is not about being bearish on rates. It is a more nuanced view that markets are too optimistic pessimistic about central banks willingness to ease. If we are right and global economic conditions turn out to be the right temperature pressure to dial up easing measures will diminish pushing government bond yields higher. However especially given investors may remain worried about future risk events we are not anticipating a substantial rise in yields and do not view interest rate management as the key to investment success in the months ahead. What is likely to be key to performance is managing exposure to credit and other nongovernment sectors. In these areas the macroeconomic backdrop should continue to be supportive and if valuations were more attractive we would be a lot more bullish and have portfolios with a lot more risk. However valuations look average to modestly expensive in many sectors. We have therefore been adjusting portfolios in ways that can benefit from earning a yield advantage without taking on too much systematic risk. In other words our risk profile is modestly aggressive and focused on situations like those in Australia and New Zealand noted above where specific idiosyncratic factors can justify a meaningful overweight position. Our positions in securitized credit emerging markets BBB and high yield exposures are being managed similarly. Carry is your friend but do not confuse carry with capital gains the majority of which are probably behind us. We cannot avoid talking about outstanding risks which remain aplenty even if they look somewhat diminished. The list is lengthy unresolved U.S. China trade talks upcoming U.S. European Union EU Japan trade negotiations Brexit oil a raft of European elections and of course the anticipated economy recovery in the second half of the year which is still an expectation rather than a fact. Indeed the global purchasing manager index PMI continues to fall and has fallen continuously for several quarters. Economic surprise indices might be rebounding but on average economic data are still printing weaker than consensus expectations. Stabilization is not the same as a tailwind suggesting we want to be in a position to take advantage of any reversal of risk appetite and underperformance of risky assets. Developed Market Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In April investor confidence continued to rally as markets continued to fare well and volatility declined. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the curve and investors took on more risk particularly as U.S. Q1 GDP figure beat expectations. Globally economic data was satisfactory as the Goldilocks conditions returned. Government bond yields also rose in other developed markets while the U.S. dollar USD strengthened marginally against the main developed economies. Outlook Following a surprisingly strong performance in the first quarter U.S. growth is likely to be lower for the remainder of 2019 as the fiscal impulse wears off and the lagged effect of higher rates bite but not collapse. Central banks have become more accommodative and we expect the lack of inflationary pressures will mean this continues although both rate cuts and hikes from the main central banks look unlikely at present. Recent speeches from Fed policymakers give us further confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee is committed to being patient and flexible on future rate hikes. At this point we do not think it is likely that the Fed will either hike or cut rates in 2019. The European Central Bank ECB has also distanced itself from speculation that it would introduce a tiered deposit system which would open the door to further rate cuts but it has also indicated very clearly to the market that no rate hikes are likely until well into 2020. Similarly the U.K. Monetary Policy Committee is likely to remain on hold for as long as Brexit remains unresolved even though labor market data would support rate hikes. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review It was a mixed picture once again for EM fixed income assets during the month. With a few exceptions EM currencies continued to weaken versus the USD while local bond and external debt returns were positive. Within the hard currency segment investment grade outperformed high yield as U.S. Treasury yields edged higher and corporates outperformed sovereigns. Commodity prices were also mixed during the period as energy prices rose while precious metals and agricultural commodity prices declined. The Institute of International Finance IIF estimated that portfolio flows into EM were $38 billion for the month with $14 billion flowing into equities and $24 billion into debt. Outlook Our constructive outlook for EM assets is based on the following factors. First Q1 real GDP data releases in both the U.S. and China point to stabilization in global growth which could potentially spill over to other countries thus boosting risky assets in general. Furthermore this incipient global growth pickup is taking place amid subdued inflationary pressures implying that key central banks see no pressing need to lessen their dovish stance and therefore rendering EM yields more attractive versus developed markets. In addition uncertainty over trade issues may diminish significantly in May provided ongoing U.S. China trade talks conclude successfully despite other matters still pending most notably potential U.S. tariffs on cars aircraft from the EU and obstacles to the United States Mexico Canada Agreement USMCA ratification by national Congresses . Additionally our USD weakness thesis which has failed to materialize so far this year could ultimately prove correct given a dovish Fed and provided that the tentative rebound in Chinese growth can spill over to Europe and EM economies. Finally to the extent that growth stabilizes and eventually accelerates it should bode well for EM credit particularly high yield sovereigns which have underperformed investment grade credits over the last year. Credit Monthly Review Supportive economic data strong earnings and positive technicals all helped drive spreads tighter in April. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index narrowed by 8 basis points in April to end the month at 110 basis points over government bonds with financials and BBB nonfinancial credits outperforming.1 European investment grade outperformed the U.S. market again by tightening 14 basis points in April to 107 basis points as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index.2 High yield bond prices continued to grind higher in April alongside equities amid a better than expected earnings season and an accommodative Fed. Spreads tightened 34 basis points to end the month at 380 basis points while yields decreased by 31 basis points to 6.12%.3 Outlook Accommodative monetary policy economic data that is not too hot nor too cold decent corporate earnings and strong demand for credit are all supportive for the markets looking forward. However while the backdrop is broadly supportive valuations are no longer as cheap with spreads now sitting below long run averages. We therefore continue to de risk most portfolios by reducing higher beta exposures such as BBBs high yield and convertible bonds. We still find credit attractive given the rather benign macro backdrop but we believe the bulk of capital gains for the year are behind us. Securitized Monthly Review Credit oriented securitized assets performed well in April while agency mortgage backed securities MBS underperformed slightly. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index was down 0.06% in April but still outperformed the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Index by 22 basis points.4 The duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS index lengthened 0.33 years to 4.36 years during April.5 The Fed s MBS portfolio shrank by $10 billion during the month to $1.583 trillion and is now $54 billion lower year to date.6 Non agency residential mortgage backed securities RMBS European MBS and U.S. asset backed securities ABS spreads tightened again in April. Outlook Mortgage and securitized markets are off to a good start in 2019 benefitting from both lower interest rates and tightening spreads. Going forward we expect returns to be more a function of cash flow carry rather than rates or spread changes as we expect interest rates to remain largely range bound for the remainder of 2019 and expect spreads to stabilize at current levels. From a fundamental perspective we believe the U.S. economy is strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments and underweight agency MBS. We expect agency MBS to continue to outperform Treasuries but underperform credit oriented securitized opportunities. 1 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of April 30 2019. 2 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of April 30 2019. 3 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of April 30 2019. 4 Source Bloomberg as of April 30 2019. 5 Source Bloomberg as of April 30 2019. 6 Source Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of April 30 2019. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2019 and are subject to change based on market economic and other conditions. Past performance is not indicative of future results. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The month of October is infamous for market volatility and this past October lived up to its reputation. Indeed it has been referred to as Red October. Most surprising was the inability of U.S. Treasury yields to rally move lower despite the dislocations occurring in equity markets. While credit markets were not as negatively impacted as equities they sold off in sympathy. Despite very weak asset markets and dire pronouncements about the impending end of the expansion we are more sanguine. We do not think this is the beginning of a broader bear market in fixed income and we expect markets to improve if gradually. U.S. Treasury yields are closing in on their likely peak U.S. economic data is likely to remain firm if a bit softer than the blistering pace of the last two quarters the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed will continue to hike interest rates but is likely to stop tightening in 2019 Chinese stimulus will hit the global economy and emerging market EM economies should stabilize. The U.S. dollar seems to have made a local peak although we would emphasize the word local for now also a good sign for EM and the global economy in general.

Note Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD. DISPLAY 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of October 31 2018. Fixed Income Outlook A notable development in October was the impressive ability of U.S. Treasuries NOT to rally e.g. see yields fall despite the selloff across equities and credit markets. Despite an approximate 10 percent selloff in equity indexes U.S. Treasury 10 year yields barely dropped 10 basis points and have since rebounded higher. Another surprise is that U.S. 10 year real yields as measured by TIPS Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rose above 1.00 percent by the end of October which breaks to the upside of their post crisis yield range. The implication is that the U.S. economy may be growing stronger for longer and or the Fed is going to have to push up short real rates to slow the economy enough to prevent inflation from rising too far. Interestingly core European government bonds despite much lower yields were able to rally in the face of lower equities and wider credit spreads. Credit markets followed equities lower and October witnessed a notable widening in spreads. This widening seems a bit overdone considering solid economic and corporate fundamentals. As such we expect a recovery stabilization in risk sentiment into year s end and possibly a narrowing of spreads. High yield bonds had outperformed other fixed income sectors this year so it was not surprising that the market struggled until the last few days of the month. Again the selloff looks overdone and we expect to see some rebound tightening in spreads . While it is difficult to know exactly what the fed funds rate peak will be we are comfortable thinking that current market pricing is not too far off e.g. a 3.25 3.5 percent level. This creates a center of gravity for U.S. rate markets to revolve around. A bold guess might be that U.S. Treasury 10 year yields peak around 3.5 percent. Only negative inflation surprises likely could drive it much higher a development we do not expect at least at the current time. From an investment perspective we remain biased toward positions that can benefit from still strong economic growth and low default probabilities. With the widening of spreads this year we think the probability of excess returns has increased and with equities well off their highs future volatility from that direction is unlikely to be negative. Assets we like both in the U.S. and Europe are non agency mortgages high yield and a select portion of investment grade credit namely financials. As we look outside the U.S. and Europe we see improved opportunities in EM. Valuations have improved substantially this year and actions in most countries have been in the right direction. We believe it will only take the absence of bad news not necessarily more good news for this asset class to perform well in the fourth quarter and into next year. Small improvements in the Chinese outlook as well as stabilization in U.S. rates and the U.S. dollar will likely create a much more benign external environment. EM could be one of the better performing fixed income sectors in the remainder of the year. Euro markets still need to contend with political uncertainty in Italy. We believe there will be a rational outcome with the European Union EU and Italy coming to an agreement over fiscal policy but the political will to execute is still lacking. It may require a more crisis like environment to get the respective parties to compromise. In the interim it will be difficulty for European credit markets to rally. Broadly we do not expect a continuation of October s performance in the months ahead. Except for U.S. Treasury yields most fixed income sectors look oversold. That said uncertainties surrounding U.S. China Trade Italian fiscal issues Brexit Chinese stimulus and over the likely direction of the U.S. dollar will keep gains muted for the time being. But with U.S. Treasury yields ever closer to their peak we are optimistic that fixed income returns will improve in the months ahead. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In October risky assets sold off again driven mainly by DM equity markets. As a result yields in Germany and other core Euro areas fell. German bunds yields fell 5 10 basis points and U.K. bonds rallied 5 15 basis points across the curve. However U.S. yields continued their seemingly inexorable rise with U.S. Treasury 10 year yields up 8 basis points and 30 year bond yields up 19 basis points steepening the yield curve. Italian government bonds sold off another 28 basis points on the long end of the curve as tensions over budget negotiations continued to rise. Impacts on other peripherals were mixed with Spanish yields up 5 10 basis points across the curve Portugal bucked the trend with short maturities rallying around 5 basis points and only marginal increases on the long end.1 Outlook We believe the Fed will continue its gradual rate hiking strategy in 2019 allowing a modest inflation overshoot. Recent meetings showed that the Fed reaffirmed its plan to hike interest rates three times in 2019 and the market is coming around to this view given recent firming pressures in wages and business confidence. As for U.S. 10 year Treasury yields we believe they will be confined to a 3 3.5 percent range. As we have previously noted Japanese Government Bonds JGBs have served to help anchor yields worldwide as has European Central Bank ECB quantitative easing QE . A wider band for JGB trading as the Bank of Japan BoJ adjusts the yield curve control policy could introduce more volatility and upward pull for risk free rates but for now the BoJ does not appear to be in a rush. In the Eurozone the ECB will likely continue to diverge from the Fed s monetary policy although it will likely end QE this year further increasing the global liquidity drain. There is no doubt that the global liquidity environment is getting less friendly. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income assets started the fourth quarter off on weaker footing as the optimism for global growth waned punctuated by a selloff in equity markets. While not calling for a recession in the near future global growth estimates have been reduced as reality has underperformed optimism. While global trade headwinds remain the outlook for North American trade improved as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement USMCA trade agreement to replace North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA was announced. Over the month soft commodities rose in price while energy markets weakened and metals were mixed. Infrastructure commodities such as aluminum and copper weakened while prices for precious metals such as gold silver platinum and palladium rose in the month. Within dollar denominated EM assets corporates outperformed sovereigns while in local debt currency weakness versus the U.S. dollar weighed on returns. Investors withdrew $1.1 billion in assets from the asset class primarily from local currency strategies as local currency debt continued to drive volatility in the month.2 Outlook While we believe second and third quarter weakness in EM valuations has created market opportunities to add risk we have become more selective as the outlook for EM fundamentals has become less certain. At a structural level the world seems to be leaving global growth synchronicity behind and entering a new phase of diverging growth as evidenced by still healthy growth in the U.S. stabilization in Europe and Japan but a more recent deceleration of activity in EM. Trade issues top the list of concerns with the U.S. and China locked in what seems likely to be a protracted battle that could undermine growth expectations more broadly. Threats that the U.S. may consider expanding tariffs to the remaining $267 billion worth of U.S. imports from China could unleash another retaliatory round from the latter thus weighing on global growth market sentiment. On the positive side however the announcement of a revamped NAFTA agreement named USMCA highlights the propensity of the U.S. to strike deals and is an important step toward removing one large source of trade related uncertainty once national congresses approve the tentative deal. Credit Monthly Review Global investment grade spreads widened in October ending the month at levels last seen in mid summer. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index spread over government bonds widened by 12 basis points in October to end the month at 118 basis points with nonfinancials leading the market wider.3 Spreads in the U.S. have now given back any gains made in the third quarter. For the year U.S. investment grade corporates are 25 basis points wider on average. In Europe the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index moved 14 basis points wider to end the month at 128 basis points relative to governments.4 European corporate bonds have now materially underperformed U.S. credit as European investment grade corporates are 42 basis points wider for the year.5 Outlook Looking forward the key question markets are asking is whether this is a healthy correction or a sign of an imminent slowdown. Our base case is that the current market volatility is a healthy midcycle correction. Corporates are seeing uncertainty over future demand and some input costs are increasing with oil higher but in general corporate results remain strong. We believe earnings growth will likely slow but do not expect leverage to increase. Leverage remains high in the U.S. but the cost of debt is quite manageable and many corporates have termed out their debt at low rates and have flexibility in their business model if additional steps to de lever are needed. In Europe leverage tends to be lower reflecting lower confidence in the broad market i.e. European companies tend to be in an earlier part of the business cycle . Uncertainty over Italy remains which will continue to be a negative for European financials and a key driver of spreads while ongoing trade disputes are likely to weigh on credits globally. Securitized Monthly Review Rising interest rates and increased volatility were the primary themes in October and spreads across nearly all securitized sectors drifted wider as a result. Credit sensitive securitized securities continued to outperform more rate sensitive securities as real estate and consumer credit conditions remained generally positive and the higher cash flow carry on credit oriented securities served as a buffer from the impacts of higher rates and wider spreads. Material upward rate moves in 2018 which have triggered increased market volatility have had an impact on both equity and fixed income asset classes. Securitized assets have generally performed well in 2018 but now appear to be feeling some pressure from higher rates and increasing volatility. Outlook Our investment thesis remains largely unchanged for November We remain generally constructive on securitized credit opportunities and cautious on U.S. agency mortgage backed securities MBS . We believe the U.S. economy remains strong due in part to improving consumer and real estate credit fundamentals. We remain underweight agency MBS due to concerns over rising rates potential higher interest rate volatility and the deteriorating supply demand dynamic with the Fed reducing its MBS purchases and large banks potentially also reducing their holdings. Although nominal spreads widened significantly in October and are now more than 25 basis points wider year to date agency MBS still look marginally expensive from a historical spread perspective and we believe spreads will need to widen to attract new investors in order to offset the Fed s reduced purchases and potentially weaker bank demand. We may begin to taper our agency MBS underweight in the coming months if the sector continues to cheapen. We believe that most of the duration extension from higher interest rates and slowing prepayment speeds has already been realized. \n",
      "Doc - Lemmatized:   the month of october be infamous for market volatility and this past october live up to reputation . indeed have be refer to as red october . most surprising be the inability of u.s. treasury yield to rally move lower despite the dislocation occur in equity market . while credit market be not as negatively impact as equity sell off in sympathy . despite very weak asset market and dire pronouncement about the impending end of the expansion be more sanguine . do not think this be the beginning of a broad bear market in fix income and expect market to improve if gradually . u.s. treasury yield be close in on likely peak u.s. economic datum be likely to remain firm if a bit soft than the blister pace of the last two quarter the u.s. federal reserve fed will continue to hike interest rate but be likely to stop tighten in 2019 chinese stimulus will hit the global economy and emerge market em economy should stabilize . the u.s. dollar seem to have make a local peak although would emphasize the word local for now also a good sign for em and the global economy in general . display 1 asset performance year to date note usd base performance . source thomson reuters datastream . datum as of october 1 2018 . the index be provide for illustrative purpose only and be not mean to depict the performance of a specific investment . past performance be no guarantee of future result . see below for index definition . display 2 currency monthly change versus u.s. dollar source bloomberg . datum as of september 30 2018 . note positive change mean appreciation of the currency against the usd . display 3 major monthly changes in 10 year yields and spreads source bloomberg jp morgan . datum as of october 31 2018 . fixed income outlook a notable development in october be the impressive ability of u.s. treasuries not to rally e.g. see yield fall despite the selloff across equity and credit market . despite an approximate 10 percent selloff in equity index u.s. treasury 10 year yield barely drop 10 basis point and have since rebound higher . another surprise be that u.s. 10 year real yield as measure by tips treasury inflation protected securities rise above 1.00 percent by the end of october which break to the upside of post crisis yield range . the implication be that the u.s. economy may be grow strong for long and or the fed be go to have to push up short real rate to slow the economy enough to prevent inflation from rise too far . interestingly core european government bond despite much low yield be able to rally in the face of low equity and wide credit spread . credit market follow equity low and october witness a notable widening in spread . this widening seem a bit overdone consider solid economic and corporate fundamental . as such expect a recovery stabilization in risk sentiment into year s end and possibly a narrowing of spread . high yield bond have outperform other fix income sector this year so be not surprising that the market struggle until the last few day of the month . again the selloff look overdone and expect to see some rebound tightening in spread . while be difficult to know exactly what the fed fund rate peak will be be comfortable thinking that current market pricing be not too far off e.g. a 3.25 3.5 percent level . this create a center of gravity for u.s. rate market to revolve around . a bold guess might be that u.s. treasury 10 year yield peak around 3.5 percent . only negative inflation surprise likely could drive much high a development do not expect at least at the current time . from an investment perspective remain biased toward position that can benefit from still strong economic growth and low default probability . with the widening of spread this year think the probability of excess return have increase and with equity well off high future volatility from that direction be unlikely to be negative . asset like both in the u.s. and europe be non agency mortgage high yield and a select portion of investment grade credit namely financial . as look outside the u.s. and europe see improved opportunity in em . valuation have improve substantially this year and action in most country have be in the right direction . believe will only take the absence of bad news not necessarily more good news for this asset class to perform well in the fourth quarter and into next year . small improvement in the chinese outlook as well as stabilization in u.s. rate and the u.s. dollar will likely create a much more benign external environment . em could be one of the better perform fix income sector in the remainder of the year . euro market still need to contend with political uncertainty in italy . believe there will be a rational outcome with the european union eu and italy come to an agreement over fiscal policy but the political will to execute be still lack . may require a more crisis like environment to get the respective party to compromise . in the interim will be difficulty for european credit market to rally . broadly do not expect a continuation of october s performance in the month ahead . except for u.s. treasury yield most fixed income sector look oversold . that say uncertainty surround u.s. china trade italian fiscal issue brexit chinese stimulus and over the likely direction of the u.s. dollar will keep gain mute for the time be . but with u.s. treasury yield ever closer to peak be optimistic that fixed income return will improve in the month ahead . developed market dm rate foreign currency fx monthly review in october risky asset sell off again drive mainly by dm equity market . as a result yield in germany and other core euro area fall . german bund yield fall 5 10 basis point and u.k. bond rally 5 15 basis point across the curve . however u.s. yield continue seemingly inexorable rise with u.s. treasury 10 year yield up 8 basis point and 30 year bond yield up 19 basis point steepen the yield curve . italian government bond sell off another 28 basis point on the long end of the curve as tension over budget negotiation continue to rise . impact on other peripheral be mix with spanish yield up 5 10 basis point across the curve portugal buck the trend with short maturity rally around 5 basis point and only marginal increase on the long end.1 outlook believe the fed will continue gradual rate hiking strategy in 2019 allow a modest inflation overshoot . recent meeting show that the fed reaffirm plan to hike interest rate three time in 2019 and the market be come around to this view give recent firming pressure in wage and business confidence . as for u.s. 10 year treasury yield believe will be confine to a 3 3.5 percent range . as have previously note japanese government bond jgb have serve to help anchor yield worldwide as have european central bank ecb quantitative ease qe . a wide band for jgb trading as the bank of japan boj adjust the yield curve control policy could introduce more volatility and upward pull for risk free rate but for now the boj do not appear to be in a rush . in the eurozone the ecb will likely continue to diverge from the fed s monetary policy although will likely end qe this year further increase the global liquidity drain . there be no doubt that the global liquidity environment be get less friendly . emerge market em rate fx monthly review em fix income asset start the fourth quarter off on weak footing as the optimism for global growth wane punctuate by a selloff in equity market . while not call for a recession in the near future global growth estimate have be reduce as reality have underperformed optimism . while global trade headwind remain the outlook for north american trade improve as the united states mexico canada agreement usmca trade agreement to replace north american free trade agreement nafta be announce . over the month soft commodity rise in price while energy market weaken and metal be mixed . infrastructure commodity such as aluminum and copper weaken while price for precious metal such as gold silver platinum and palladium rise in the month . within dollar denominate em asset corporate outperform sovereign while in local debt currency weakness versus the u.s. dollar weigh on return . investor withdraw $ 1.1 billion in asset from the asset class primarily from local currency strategy as local currency debt continue to drive volatility in the month.2 outlook while believe second and third quarter weakness in em valuation have create market opportunity to add risk have become more selective as the outlook for em fundamental have become less certain . at a structural level the world seem to be leave global growth synchronicity behind and enter a new phase of diverging growth as evidence by still healthy growth in the u.s. stabilization in europe and japan but a more recent deceleration of activity in em . trade issue top the list of concern with the u.s. and china lock in what seem likely to be a protract battle that could undermine growth expectation more broadly . threat that the u.s. may consider expand tariff to the remain $ 267 billion worth of u.s. import from china could unleash another retaliatory round from the latter thus weigh on global growth market sentiment . on the positive side however the announcement of a revamp nafta agreement name usmca highlight the propensity of the u.s. to strike deal and be an important step toward remove one large source of trade related uncertainty once national congress approve the tentative deal . credit monthly review global investment grade spread widen in october end the month at level last see in mid summer . the bloomberg barclays u.s. corporate index spread over government bond widen by 12 basis point in october to end the month at 118 basis point with nonfinancial lead the market wider.3 spread in the u.s. have now give back any gain make in the third quarter . for the year u.s. investment grade corporate be 25 basis point wide on average . in europe the bloomberg barclays euro aggregate corporate index move 14 basis point wide to end the month at 128 basis point relative to governments.4 european corporate bond have now materially underperformed u.s. credit as european investment grade corporate be 42 basis point wide for the year.5 outlook look forward the key question market be ask be whether this be a healthy correction or a sign of an imminent slowdown . base case be that the current market volatility be a healthy midcycle correction . corporate be see uncertainty over future demand and some input cost be increase with oil high but in general corporate result remain strong . believe earning growth will likely slow but do not expect leverage to increase . leverage remain high in the u.s. but the cost of debt be quite manageable and many corporate have term out debt at low rate and have flexibility in business model if additional step to de lever be need . in europe leverage tend to be low reflect low confidence in the broad market i.e. european company tend to be in an early part of the business cycle . uncertainty over italy remain which will continue to be a negative for european financial and a key driver of spread while ongoing trade dispute be likely to weigh on credit globally . securitized monthly review rise interest rate and increase volatility be the primary theme in october and spread across nearly all securitized sector drift wider as a result . credit sensitive securitized security continue to outperform more rate sensitive security as real estate and consumer credit condition remain generally positive and the high cash flow carry on credit orient security serve as a buffer from the impact of high rate and wide spread . material upward rate move in 2018 which have trigger increase market volatility have have an impact on both equity and fix income asset class . securitized asset have generally perform well in 2018 but now appear to be feel some pressure from high rate and increase volatility . outlook investment thesis remain largely unchanged for november remain generally constructive on securitized credit opportunity and cautious on u.s. agency mortgage back security mbs . believe the u.s. economy remain strong due in part to improve consumer and real estate credit fundamental . remain underweight agency mbs due to concern over rise rate potential high interest rate volatility and the deteriorate supply demand dynamic with the fed reduce mbs purchase and large bank potentially also reduce holding . although nominal spread widen significantly in october and be now more than 25 basis point wide year to date agency mbs still look marginally expensive from a historical spread perspective and believe spread will need to widen to attract new investor in order to offset the fed s reduce purchase and potentially weak bank demand . may begin to taper agency mbs underweight in the come month if the sector continue to cheapen . believe that most of the duration extension from high interest rate and slow prepayment speed have already be realize .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Second quarter earnings season is now in full swing raising the question of what investors can expect from the rest of 2019 and into 2020. At first glance two contradictions make for a puzzling read. First although corporate profit growth is expected to be tepid this year the S P 500 Index is up more than 20% year to date closing above 3000 for the first time in mid July. Second investors are skittish about the prospect of slower economic growth yet for the most part markets have seen pretty low volatility. In the face of such incongruities it s important to stay focused but only on the big picture. Equity markets may still have room to run but investors shouldn t be surprised by a summer sell off. This is all consistent with long term bull markets which rarely follow a linear pattern. Instead they follow a predictable though admittedly frustrating rhythm of rally retest recovery and repeat. Here are four key points to factor into investment decisions heading into the later part of this year. Equity Markets Are an Earnings Indicator Markets aren t always rational but history has shown that equity markets do a decent job of predicting earnings as we ve seen over the past year. The stock market sell off in at the end of 2018 predicted the earnings recession and economic slowdown this year though in hindsight it now seems exaggerated. By the same token I believe the equity market rally in 2019 may be predicting an earnings recovery and economic improvement later in 2019 and into 2020. Keep in mind that earnings recessions and recoveries are all relative. High double digit earnings growth in 2018 thanks in part to the federal tax cut passed at the end of 2017 made for tough comparables going into 2019. As those comparisons roll off however it sets a more realistic bar for 2020. My colleagues in the firm s Global Investment Committee have nuanced views on how an earnings recession could spiral into an economic recession in 2020 but an earnings recession does not always mean an economic recession as you can see in the chart below. That distinction is critical when thinking about the longer term prospects of this market cycle. Display 1 Market corrections have historically preceded earnings recessions even without being associated with economic recessions Source St. Louis Fed U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Bloomberg Past performance is no guide to future performance and the value of investments and income from them can fall as well as rise. Indices are unmanaged and not available for direct investment. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. This Market Still Has Room to Run Continued strength in earnings against the backdrop of easier comparables is just one of the reasons to question the doom and gloom narrative that has kept some investors on the sidelines. As I ve pointed out before bear markets are typically born out of excessive optimism coupled with deteriorating economics. Yet investors are still sitting on the sidelines after cashing out of equity funds and ETFs late last year. Other key factors also bode well for equities markets. The financial conditions index suggests that the U.S. economy is still very healthy and with the U.S. presidential election around the corner the Trump administration will likely do everything it can to nudge the economy. Although the U.S. Treasury bond yield between three month and 10 year rates inverted earlier this year it s now back in positive territory. The initial inversion of the yield curve tends to precede market peaks by a full two years historically U.S. stocks have gained 40% on average during that period. In another vote of confidence companies continue to raise dividends even in the face of lower rates. Notably nearly half of the companies in the S P 500 recently had a higher dividend yield than the 10 year Treasury. A Short Term Pullback Is Likely At the same time many investors have stayed on the sidelines of this year s rally. Evidence also shows that investors who are in the market may have grown a bit complacent. So far in 2019 the market has only experienced a decline of 1% or more in seven instances vs. 32 times in 2018. Translation The market may be overdue for some volatility. Admittedly trying to time short term pullbacks within the context of a secular bull market is tricky. Still given the lack of volatility and past patterns of pullbacks now probably isn t the time to be turning up the volume on portfolio risk. Investors worried about a summer selloff may want to trim their direct market exposure but they shouldn t lose site of the long game. As we ve seen throughout this cycle selloffs have set the scene for further gains. Keep in mind too that despite new highs for the S P 500 the market was effectively flat for 350 days between January 2018 and June 2019. Since 1900 there have been just seven times when the market was effectively flat for 350 days. In all such instances the market was up six months later. Source FactSet Sentiment Trader June 19 2019.

Safety Stocks Have Been Overbought As investors have gotten skittish this year many have turned to consumer staples and other seemingly safe stocks. However if there is any bubble in the market right now it s in companies perceived as being recession proof. The quality growth spread the valuation of the highest quality growth decile of the Russell 1000 relative to the market average was recently two standard deviations higher than its baseline. Likewise the earnings stability spread was 1.5 standard deviations more expensive. Here is where you find the serious crowding. In a market pullback overbought stocks pose the biggest risk. Investors should neither think that high quality growth stocks are the answer to market uncertainty nor should they blindly rotate out of growth into value. Yes value stocks have gotten increasingly cheap and we think that investors have opportunities to select bargains. Yet ultimately the best time to broadly buy value stocks is after a bona fide recession. True leadership change in the market never happens until after a bear market and all indicators suggest that we just aren t there yet. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  It was an exciting end to the year with most markets moving in diametrically opposite directions from earlier in the year. The December dramatic drop in 10 year U.S. Treasury yields and pricing out of all U.S. rate hikes in 2019 was driven in large part by the poor performance of risky assets high yield and leveraged loans the previous darlings of the bond market and equities which saw their largest monthly drop in many years. It was not one specific event driving this shift it was a plethora of problems disappointing macro data across developed economies political troubles U.S. China trade government shutdowns poor sentiment market mispositioning and of course poor liquidity enhanced by end of year balance sheet constraints. It is a struggle to find good news which of course may mean it cannot get worse We will have to see. We do know that despite the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed raising rates eight times in the past two years the U.S. 10 year Treasury yield has only moved up 24 basis points bps post dramatic Q4 rally . A flattening of the yield curve of historic proportions certainly belies confidence that the U.S. economy can sustain growth much above levels prevalent post the global financial crisis. The risk of a more dramatic economic slowdown from tightening too quickly remains remote in our opinion. We think that moderate growth stable inflation and a patient Fed is an excellent recipe for engineering a soft landing for the U.S. and global economy and good performance of risky assets.

Note Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD. DISPLAY 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of December 31 2018. Fixed Income Outlook Investors hoping for a Santa Claus rally in December were disappointed with developed market DM equities experiencing their worst month since September 2011 while investment grade credit spreads sold off to their widest levels since the first half of 2016. On the face of it one might have thought value minded investors would be encouraged by the sell off and the opportunity to buy equities at lower valuation multiples and be paid more to take on corporate default risk but the situation is more complex than that. Economic data especially in developed economies generally surprised to the downside in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while company earnings generally held up well through the year expectations for 2019 have been revised steadily lower. In addition many of the main macro risks trade tensions between the U.S. and China populist politics in Europe concerns about the slowing Chinese economy remain unresolved. However the other significant development over the last month is the policy response to the weakening growth data and financial markets performance. The trend toward monetary policy normalization which was firmly on track in the first half of the year appears to be stuttering to a halt and in some cases reversing. Inflation everywhere remains subdued so central banks can take their time with normalizing policy reducing the risks of a policy accident from tightening too much too soon. The Fed delivered more rate hikes in 2018 than the market had initially expected four rather than three but now finds itself in the situation where policy rates are approaching neutral the risks to tightening much further seem greater and the need to do so not particularly pressing. Inflationary pressures did recover through 2018 but U.S. core inflation measures have at most returned to the target level rather than over shooting. U.S. job creation surged far more than expected in December but the unemployment rate rose at the same time as discouraged workers rejoined the workforce suggesting there is still slack in the U.S. labor market which will moderate inflationary pressures. In Europe the European Central Bank ECB ended its quantitative easing QE program but the path and pace of raising interest rates is expected to be an extraordinarily slow one. While the ECB is sticking with its view that the weakness in the eurozone economy is transitory and that tighter and more rigid labor markets will lead to rising underlying inflationary pressures there is very little evidence of this translating into higher consumer prices with core CPI unchanged at 1 percent year over year in December. As in the past the ECB may have to push out the timing of its policy normalization. Possibly the most significant change in monetary policy came from the People s Bank of China PBoC as the required reserve ratios RRR were cut to support the slowing Chinese economy. Interestingly though while emerging markets EM were a major source of market volatility in the first half of 2018 they managed to outperform DM in the second half of 2018. This improved resilience makes sense to us given most emerging economies are in better shape than many investors feared those with imbalances took corrective actions to address them and with valuations undemanding there are attractive investment opportunities. A slower pace of Fed rate hikes which may lead to a weaker U.S. dollar could add further support to the asset class. Despite these rather large changes in asset prices analysts including our own macro and corporate forecasts for 2019 have not changed nearly as dramatically. Yes growth will moderate in 2019. But will it collapse No in our opinion. And for the U.S. in particular this is a good thing. If U.S. growth continues at the third quarter pace there is no doubt in our minds that this would lead to higher inflation and possibly more aggressive Fed rate hikes and a higher probability of recession in 2020 and beyond. So the silver lining of the market s reappraisal of U.S. and global growth and inflation dynamics is that there is substantially less pressure for central banks to either normalize policy eurozone Japan China or continue to raise rates U.S. . The risk of a more dramatic economic slowdown from a too quick pace of tightening or a collapse in household or corporate confidence remains remote in our opinion. We think that moderate growth stable inflation and a patient Fed is an excellent recipe for engineering a soft landing for the U.S. and global economy and good performance of risky assets. The notable resilience of EM in the second half of the year dramatically so in December is further supportive of the global economy and of the EM asset class. Risky asset prices have overshot their fundamental values. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review Safe haven yields fell in December following the initial euphoria after the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires falling inflation expectations and a continuation of the flight to quality from mid November. During the month the U.S. and China agreed on a truce for the next 90 days wherein the U.S. would push back increasing tariffs on more than $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent as had been planned in January and China committed to purchase a very substantial amount of farm energy and industrial goods in order to reduce the trade gap with the U.S. The market reaction was short lived as news shortly emerged that Huawei s CFO was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S. government for alleged violations of Iranian sanctions. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower in 2019 as the fiscal impulse wears off and the lagged effect of higher rates bite but it will not collapse. Recent speeches from Fed policymakers give us further confidence that they are cognizant of the risk of overtightening and the need to move at some point in the near future to a more data dependent policy. The Fed wants to contain inflation risk it does not want to cause a hard landing recession. In the shorter term despite the dip lower toward the end of December we believe that the 10 year U.S. Treasury yield is likely to spend a majority of the time between 2.75 and 3.25 percent for the next several months. Fed tightening is on hiatus. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income assets posted positive performance in the final month of the year partially offsetting losses incurred throughout the year. During the month of December falling U.S. Treasury yields aided longer duration higher quality bonds in the dollar denominated sovereign and corporate market while local bond performance drove domestic debt returns. Over the month energy and base metal prices continued to fall as Brent oil ended at almost $54 barrel and copper and aluminum prices weakened over 3 percent. Soft commodities returns were mixed with corn and wheat prices rising versus losses for coffee sugar and cotton. While base metal prices fell prices for gold silver and palladium rose in the period. Investors continued to withdraw investments from the EM debt asset class in December primarily from hard currency strategies. The year ended with institutional investors adding roughly $20 billion to the asset class 1 while retail investments were roughly flat. Outlook After a challenging year for EM fixed income we hold a constructive outlook for 2019 driven by attractive valuations a potentially benign global backdrop of moderate growth subdued inflation and a Fed that is likely approaching the end of its tightening cycle. We believe these factors and growing twin deficits in the U.S. limit the scope for material USD appreciation which would be beneficial to EM borrowers. Our historical analysis indicates that EM fixed income tends to outperform when EM economies are closing negative output gaps and converging toward potential growth as they are currently doing. Credit Monthly Review Global investment grade spreads widened in December ending the worst year for investment grade spreads since the 2011 European sovereign crisis. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index widened by 16 bps in December to end the year at 153 bps over government bonds with BBB credits leading the market lower. For the year spreads closed 60 bps wider with lower quality credit like subordinated financials and BBB nonfinancials underperforming. As measured by excess returns the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Investment Grade Index s 3.15 percent annual return was the second worst since 2008. As in prior months the drivers of credit remained macroeconomic concerns and worries about how slowing economic growth would impact company fundamentals especially leverage in BBB credit . Compounding these worries were poor technicals headed into year end the most notable symptom being limited risk appetite in the dealer community. Outlook Entering 2019 our outlook remains broadly unchanged. With the additional widening in December spreads are now back to early to mid 2016 levels and pricing in an elevated risk of a material economic slowdown or recession. We believe an awful lot is currently baked into valuations and hence we see value in both investment grade and high yield credit spreads. While December s underperformance adds ammunition to some commentators view that credit markets are in crisis we see known dangers that are already priced into the market. We believe this creates opportunities for carry and limited capital gains through active positioning. Securitized Monthly Review Widening securitized credit spreads and rallying interest rates continued in December. Securitized credit spreads have now widened for three consecutive months and finished wider for 2018 across most sectors. Fundamental securitized credit conditions remain sound with low default rates healthy consumer balance sheets and stable housing markets but increasing volatility greater concerns over the future health of the U.S. economy and widening spreads in other credit sectors are combining to put pressure on securitized credit spreads. Agency mortgage backed securities MBS performed well again in December with spreads tightening and rates rallying and agency MBS returns moved into positive territory for 2018 for the first time all year. Outlook We enter 2019 with a positive outlook on the securitized markets. With LIBOR and U.S. Treasury yields higher across the curve in 2018 and with securitized spreads wider on everything from agency MBS to credit sensitive asset backed securities ABS we begin 2019 with materially higher securitized investment yields and a still positive fundamental credit environment. Market volatility has increased and could still increase further but ultimately we expect fundamental value and credit performance to dominate returns for 2019. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

one might have think value minded investor would be encourage by the sell off and the opportunity to buy equity at low valuation multiple and be pay more to take on corporate default risk but the situation be more complex than that . economic datum especially in develop economy generally surprised to the downside in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while company earning generally hold up well through the year expectation for 2019 have be revise steadily low . in addition many of the main macro risk trade tension between the u.s. and china populist politic in europe concern about the slow chinese economy remain unresolved . however the other significant development over the last month be the policy response to the weakening growth datum and financial market performance . the trend toward monetary policy normalization which be firmly on track in the first half of the year appear to be stutter to a halt and in some case reverse . inflation everywhere remain subdue so central bank can take time with normalize policy reduce the risk of a policy accident from tighten too much too soon . the fed deliver more rate hike in 2018 than the market have initially expect four rather than three but now find in the situation where policy rate be approach neutral the risk to tighten much further seem great and the need to do so not particularly press . inflationary pressure do recover through 2018 but u.s. core inflation measure have at most return to the target level rather than over shooting . u.s. job creation surge far more than expect in december but the unemployment rate rise at the same time as discourage worker rejoin the workforce suggest there be still slack in the u.s. labor market which will moderate inflationary pressure . in europe the european central bank ecb end quantitative ease qe program but the path and pace of raise interest rate be expect to be an extraordinarily slow one . while the ecb be stick with view that the weakness in the eurozone economy be transitory and that tight and more rigid labor market will lead to rise underlie inflationary pressure there be very little evidence of this translate into high consumer price with core cpi unchanged at 1 percent year over year in december . as in the past the ecb may have to push out the timing of policy normalization . possibly the most significant change in monetary policy come from the people s bank of china pboc as the require reserve ratio rrr be cut to support the slow chinese economy . interestingly though while emerge market em be a major source of market volatility in the first half of 2018 manage to outperform dm in the second half of 2018 . this improved resilience make sense to give most emerge economy be in well shape than many investor fear those with imbalance take corrective action to address and with valuation undemanding there be attractive investment opportunity . a slow pace of fed rate hike which may lead to a weak u.s. dollar could add further support to the asset class . despite these rather large change in asset price analyst include own macro and corporate forecast for 2019 have not change nearly as dramatically . yes growth will moderate in 2019 . but will collapse no in opinion . and for the u.s. in particular this be a good thing . if u.s. growth continue at the third quarter pace there be no doubt in mind that this would lead to high inflation and possibly more aggressive fed rate hike and a high probability of recession in 2020 and beyond . so the silver lining of the market s reappraisal of u.s. and global growth and inflation dynamic be that there be substantially less pressure for central bank to either normalize policy eurozone japan china or continue to raise rate u.s. . the risk of a more dramatic economic slowdown from a too quick pace of tightening or a collapse in household or corporate confidence remain remote in opinion . think that moderate growth stable inflation and a patient fed be an excellent recipe

      "Doc - Orig:  What an extraordinary month June was. Virtually every financial asset generated a positive return. This is a very rare occurrence and even more extraordinary as it occurred with economic data deteriorating and disappointing across the globe. What gives Central banks are what gives. The European Central Bank ECB and the U.S. Federal reserve Fed independently signaled their willingness to do a volte face and emphasize downside economic risks significantly changing the likely direction of monetary policy. When it was hard to out dove markets these two central banks did it. And guess what Financial markets loved it. Despite weak data something credit and equities should not have liked markets rallied. All of them almost indiscriminately. Even the dollar took a tumble as risk premium vanished as well as the U.S. yield advantage. By suggesting monetary easing was imminent BEFORE a recession hit or was about to hit these two central banks hit the sweet spot what we mean by that is that their surprising dovishness did not panic markets e.g. well if the Fed is that worried maybe so should I . Instead the cavalry was coming in time to save the day. We cannot emphasize enough the unusualness of this market performance. It is emblematic of a market unprepared for the cavalry to arrive and underinvested in everything. It also did not hurt that Presidents Trump and Xi managed to call a truce on their trade dispute. Now the hard part The Fed and the ECB have to deliver. And after they do it has to work Just because policy rates yields and spreads go down doesn t mean the economy must do better. This is not physics. What has to happen is that spending goes up. And this means companies have to reverse their declining investment plans and keep hiring and consumers have to keep spending and the trade war cannot heat up again and we can t have a hard Brexit. A long list. It is unclear how far yields and spreads will have to fall to trigger a stabilization and rebound in business confidence and spending. What we are sure about is that central banks even if their policy tool box is getting threadbare will go out guns blazing meaning they will do all in their power to insure this expansion does not end this year or next. So far we agree with that prognosis given their abrupt change of mind. Display 1 Asset Performance Year To Date USD based performance. Source Thomson Reuters Datastream. Data as of June 30 2019.

Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of June 30 2019. Fixed Income Outlook Our hope that central banks around the world would realize the precarious situation the global economy was headed towards was rewarded. With the ECB and Fed signaling ease and the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting rates we are more confident that market pricing of credit and government bonds both developed and emerging is not wrong. Anticipating good things happening yes but the probability of those good things happening is now much higher than in May. But here s the caveat. Central banks need to deliver. And not in a drip feed way. They need to impress. Can they do it Of course. Will they We will have to wait and see. We are cautiously optimistic. Global manufacturing business surveys have fallen for fourteen months in a row. This needs to stop. Will it Not sure. Global trade disputes layered onto other more mundane issues such as China s rebalancing of its economy and fostering deleveraging make it a challenge. Cutting rates additional quantitative easing all help we think but you can t force companies and households to borrow. That takes renewed confidence about the future. If these trade disputes go on and on there will be no reason for companies to unleash their animal spirits. What do we need to look out for On the bullish side we need to see business confidence improve. On the bearish side the reverse In the 2015 slowdown the service sector held up well buoyed by a strong consumer. The spillover from manufacturing to non manufacturing did not happen. We need to see the same now. If the service sector slows we might see firms reducing employment undercutting household confidence and initiating a negative spiral of slower growth slower hiring etc. Surprisingly to us at least we have not changed our views on the merits of various markets around the world or sector positioning. This is primarily due to the fact that our views on the likelihood of central banks delivering easier policy have become more confident. Diversified overweight positions in Australia New Zealand Spain and Greece still look good. More modest overweights in investment grade and high yield also make sense given the likelihood that central banks at a minimum should be able to stave off recession. Yes spreads are tighter but with government bond yields quickly evaporating around the world credit markets are big enough to take their place. Securitized credit still looks like a relatively safe harbor in a fragile volatile and uncertain world and thus is our large overweight. Emerging markets also benefit from the change of direction of developed country monetary policy. While a weaker global economy and reductions in global trade volume are not good significantly easier financial conditions alongside a weaker dollar provide a very decent backdrop. Of course local fundamentals remain important. As usual we prefer countries with steep yield curves and decent fundamentals. This leads to a natural differentiator among countries. To repeat our usual mantra the right fundamentals at the right price. Mexican and Brazilian rates along with Indonesia are some of our current favorites. In a world increasingly starved of yield and we mean any yield emerging markets stand out as places where there still is nominal and real yield. This should lead to continued good performance. Looking to the future nimbleness is going to be necessary to navigate increasingly complicated markets. With monetary policy on the move markets anticipating rightly or wrongly big policy moves trade disputes ever present and elections coming up investors are going to have to make key decisions about what tradeoffs central banks will make with regard to forestalling recession pressures by preemptive moves nowadays called insurance cuts and acting too cautiously letting recessionary forces become too strong to stop. Developed Market Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In June investors centered their attention on global central bank meetings and trade negotiations as both the highly anticipated June Federal Open Market Committee FOMC and the G20 summit were held. While volatility was subdued during the month the 10 year Treasury fell below 2% for the first time since 2016. Other developed market bonds followed suit as yields continued to fall across the globe particularly in countries like Spain and Italy. Central banks across the developed markets placed an emphasis on accommodative monetary policy led by the FOMC and ECB over the course of the month. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower for the remainder of 2019 although stabilizing via easier monetary policy. Central banks have become more accommodative particularly in the U.S. and eurozone and we expect that to continue as uncertainty in the geopolitical and economic landscape remains prevalent. We currently see three major risks to the outlook Brexit U.S. China trade disputes and the U.S. presidential elections. Recent speeches from the Fed policymakers give us further confidence that the Fed is committed to being flexible regarding future monetary rate policy. With that being said at this point we believe multiple insurance rate cuts may be warranted over the next twelve months to help lengthen the economic cycle and avoid a recession. And with inflation below the Fed s target level it s difficult to see why it would not want to do this. In the shorter term we believe that the U.S. 10 Year Treasury yield is likely to spend a majority of the time between 1.75 and 2.25% for the next several months. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review A dovish Fed statement and a pause in trade tension escalation helped EM fixed income asset prices post strong gains in the month. The strong month brought year to date total returns to the high single low double digit range. Within hard currency assets the high yield segment outperformed the investment grade segment and sovereigns outperformed corporates as falling U.S. Treasury yields aided longer duration assets. EM domestic debt led the way in the month with a mix of currency strength and local bond performance helping close the YTD performance gap with dollar denominated debt. Commodity prices were broadly stronger in the period with oil prices rebounding almost 10% as supply stocks fell and OPEC announced that they would extend their production cuts. Metal prices continued to see strength with supply disruptions supporting the price of iron ore and gold continuing to gain favor with investors in part as an alternative to negative yielding government debt. Soft commodities also performed well as coffee sugar wheat and soybean prices rose while cotton and cattle prices continued to weaken. Outlook Though downward growth revisions have increased primarily in Asia and in key Latin American economies Brazil and Mexico dovish central banks in developed economies as well as subdued domestic inflationary backdrops should allow EM central banks to maintain monetary stimulus. Furthermore some countries with prudent fiscal frameworks could support dwindling growth via more active fiscal policy. We also remain optimistic on structural reforms in several EM countries. For example we expect a successful social security reform in Brazil that despite some dilution will achieve sizable savings in the next 10 years and improve the country s debt dynamics. Policy continuity in countries such as India and Indonesia and also in the Philippines after local election that favored incumbent President Duterte should also be supportive of economic growth and reforms. On the negative side the failure of global trade to pick up and or a more pronounced slowdown in China s activity could be detrimental to trade intensive EM economies. Finally presidential elections in Argentina could add to volatility though the latest political developments and the FX stability have contributed to improving the reelection odds of market friendly President Macri. Credit Monthly Review Corporate bonds performed well in June as risk appetite returned on the back of hopes for U.S. China progress. Spreads tightened in June as quickly as they widened in May amid dovish turns by the Fed and ECB as well as U.S. China trade optimism. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index closed 14 basis points bps tighter in June to end the month at 114 bps over government bonds with longer dated and LT2 financial credits outperforming.1 High yield spreads tightened 56bps to end the month at 377 and yields fell 70bps to 5.87%.2 U.S. Investment Grade Index generated an excess return of 2.45% in June with YTD returns of 3.91% while high yield returned 2.28% in June bringing total YTD returns to 9.94%.3 Outlook Our strategy has been to take profits on long held positions as spreads move below the long run average and that triggered profit taking in the month but we remain net long risk looking to be tactical over the coming quarter. While valuations got richer following strong performance in the first half of 2019 the risks of recession remain. Uncertainty around global trade and weaker growth make the short term outlook for corporate earnings less clear. Our base case does not call for a recession rather we expect continued low global growth and low inflation supported by low real rates and easy financial conditions. We are carefully monitoring the incoming economic data with heightened focus on employment trends as well as comments from central banks to see if the central bank economic put such as another quantitative easing program in Europe will be rekindled which would likely quickly reinforce market confidence. Securitized Monthly Review The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index was up 0.72% in June but underperformed the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Index which was up 0.92% as MBS durations shortened as interest rates declined.4 Current coupon agency mortgage backed securities MBS nominal spreads widened 2 bps in June to 87 bps above interpolated U.S. Treasuries.5 The duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index shortened by nearly a quarter of a year to 3.15 years during June as mortgage prepayment speeds are expected to accelerate as a result of lower mortgage rates.6 National mortgage rates were 23 bps lower in June ending at 3.80% down 103 bps from November.7 Lower coupon agency MBS outperformed higher coupon MBS as prepayment concerns have a greater negative impact on the higher coupon MBS. The Fed MBS portfolio shrank by $23 billion during June to $1.533 trillion and is now $104 billion lower year to date.8 Outlook While we are becoming more cautious on both interest rate risk and credit risk at current levels we still believe that securitized fundamental credit conditions will remain positive and that credit sensitive mortgage and securitized assets will continue to perform well. We have reduced our underweight in agency MBS given its underperformance year to date makes it now more attractive on a risk adjusted basis even if we still have concerns about faster prepayments and supply pressure from the Fed. We remain moderately positive on residential mortgage backed securities RMBS as we are positive on the U.S. housing market and residential credit conditions. We have reduced our positioning in commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS but we believe the CMBS market remains very idiosyncratic in terms of its opportunity set and risk profile. In U.S. asset backed securities ABS we continue to have a positive outlook on consumer credit sectors as consumer balance sheets are in good shape due to low unemployment increasing wages higher savings rates and consumer confidence levels that remain high by historical comparison. Total consumer debt remains at a reasonable level interest rates remain historically low and credit card utilization rates are near the lowest levels in 20 years. In European RMBS we are constructive on residential real estate credit conditions despite the volatile political environment. 1 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of June 30 2019 2 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of June 30 2019 3 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of June 30 2019 4 Source Bloomberg as of June 30 2019 5 Source JP Morgan as of June 30 2019 6 Source Bloomberg as of June 30 2019 7 Source Bloomberg as of June 30 2019 8 Source Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of June 30 2019 RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2019 and are subject to change based on market economic and other conditions. Past performance is not indicative of future results. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Despite the strong recovery in many risky assets since Christmas the market s mood remains sober. Even as global equities have risen almost 17% over this period the majority of investors have continued to be skeptical of the rally and lightly positioned.1 Investor survey data in March showed that fund manager positioning in global equities is at levels last seen in the prior mid cycle slowdown of 2016.2 The dovish policy turn most notably by the Federal Reserve the Fed but also the European Central Bank ECB was a major force that lifted risky assets and led to a pronounced global rates rally.

      "Doc - Orig:  What a difference a month makes In April the U.S. China trade negotiations were anticipated to wrap up U.S. relations with Mexico and Canada were on the mend and U.S. trade negotiations with Europe were not anticipated to cause too much trouble at least in the short term. Come May none of these things happened indeed they all deteriorated. Not surprisingly developed market government bonds rallied significantly what was more surprising was that peripheral European and emerging market local government bond yields also rallied. Indeed on our count ALL bond markets rallied except for Italy and South Africa. Credit markets did not fare as well though with both investment grade and high yield spreads widening but not to the extent that might have been expected. Lastly the dollar strengthened across the board. D j vu Maybe not. The January Powell Pivot is key to understanding market behavior in May and beyond. The big difference from last year is that the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed is in play. We have already seen central banks in New Zealand and Australia cut rates in recent weeks. With few signs of a rebound in the macroeconomic data just about everywhere and downside risks to growth growing due to the escalating trade war the probability of a Fed ease is rising steadily as it is for most central banks. This is supportive for government bond markets credit markets and equities but not supportive of the dollar . Thus market developments should be materially different from the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not believe a recession either in the U.S. Europe or globally will occur UNLESS unemployment rates start rising and households retrench. This makes government bonds look expensive relative to current conditions but markets are forward looking and have correctly anticipated deteriorating global conditions. Until proven wrong markets will likely keep on their current trajectory. Conclusion Keep one eye on the U.S. consumer and one eye on Chinese policymakers oh and don t forget to keep that third eye on trade negotiations . Things should be OK but better to be prudent and not be too bullish or bearish. Display 1 Asset Performance Year To Date USD based performance. Source Thomson Reuters Datastream.

Fixed Income Outlook Last month we wrote about continuity. Well that did not last long. The resurrection of trade war fears has shortcircuited the rise in government bond yields and pressed credit spreads wider. We were sympathetic to the idea of somewhat wider credit spreads on valuation grounds but we did not anticipate that the underperformance would be driven by trade especially with central banks globally moving to an easing bias or actual easing. The market implied probability of a U.S. rate cut this year is virtually 100%. Cumulatively markets are looking for at least three cuts this year and next fast moving to a full 100 basis points cut by the end of next year. However while investors are worried about the future the hard economic data is not that bad currently without trade war fears market expectations for rate cuts would likely be much lower. If somehow the U.S. and China suddenly maybe miraculously sorted out their differences there could be a significant repricing of yields and rate cut expectations but that may be too sanguine. The issues in question appear to be more deep rooted and difficult to sort out meaning any truce in the trade war would not be taken too positively by markets which would anticipate a return to arms so to speak at some point in the future. Thus for now the trend is your friend and the direction of official rates is lower until something changes for the better. Without a good idea of how this standoff concludes or doesn t adopting a neutral view on rates overall seems prudent. We still like to own those markets where good things are happening Australia and New Zealand whose central banks are cutting rates Spanish long duration bonds which are benefiting from curve flattening and credit spread tightening and a reach for yield in a world of negative yields Brazilian government bonds are aided by a steep yield curve and friendly central bank. These are the places we hold above average interest rate risk. In the U.S. and eurozone overall we would be neutral. Emerging markets have performed well given the trade war news. This reflects the very different circumstances this year compared to 2018. Countries with good fundamentals and going in the right direction are doing fine. Those struggling with either poor economic data or following wrong policies from the market s point of view are underperforming. As we have written about many times focusing on good stories at the right price is key to good performance. There are countries that meet these criteria and we believe they should do fine in a period of easier developed market monetary policy subject to not being in the crosshairs of U.S. trade negotiators . Clearly the world changed once again in May. How long this lasts and its final impact are unknown. The combination of deep uncertainty difficult to hedge and poor economic data makes credit investing a challenge. Valuations have gotten cheaper and on our assumption that the world will escape a recession this year and next credit should do okay. However credit markets are holding up because the market expects the Fed to ease substantially starting in fact in July. A failure of the Fed to act in either June or July could easily lead to disappointment and further spread widening. We are sticking with our view that portfolios with relatively modest credit risk choosing the right bonds and sectors in investment grade and high yield can generate meaningful carry either outright or versus a benchmark. Our underweights in government bonds are generally much lower than they were in April. We must remember that 2019 is not 2018 and different strategies are warranted in these very different circumstances. Developed Market Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In May investors once again fled to safe haven assets with sovereign bond yields across developed markets tumbling to historic lows. Benchmark yields in Australia New Zealand and Germany fell to their lowest levels ever. The U.S. 10 year Treasury yield dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years coupled with the fact that U.S. Treasuries had their best May since 2003 with the 10 year Treasury up 3% in total returns.1 Additionally a key measure of the yield curve inverted over the month with the spread between the 10 year U.S. Treasury and three month U.S. Treasury bill falling into negative territory. Global geopolitical risks including trade issues with China and Mexico and central bank rhetoric within the developed markets have caused uncertainty among investors pushing markets into a risk off mindset within fixed income. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower for the remainder of 2019 as the fiscal impulse wears off and the lagged effect of higher rates bite but not collapse. Central banks have become more accommodative particularly in the U.S. Antipodea and eurozone and we expect that to continue. Recent speeches from the Fed policymakers give us further confidence that the Fed is committed to being patient and flexible regarding future rate hikes and cuts. With that being said at this point it is distinctly possible the Fed will cut rates in 2019. The bar for cuts may be higher than the market thinks and even higher for the magnitude being discounted but further market turbulence and weak economic data over the summer could lead them to act. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income assets gained during the month. Within hard currency investment grade outperformed high yield and sovereigns outperformed corporates as falling U.S. Treasury yields aided longer duration assets.2 With a few exceptions EM currencies continued to weaken versus the U.S. dollar though local bond performance more than offset the negative impact from currency depreciation.3 Commodity prices were broadly lower in the period with oil prices falling more than 13% and most base metal prices also in decline.4 Iron ore and gold were the exceptions with metals supply disruptions supporting the price of iron ore.5 Soft commodities outperformed as wheat soybeans coffee and corn prices rose while cotton and cattle prices weakened.6 The Institute of International Finance estimated that portfolio flows out of EM were $5.7 billion in May with $14.6 billion flowing out of EM equities one of the worst months for that asset class since the Taper Tantrum of 2013. Meanwhile $9 billion flowed into EM debt markets. Outlook One of the risks we have consistently flagged in previous outlooks namely heightened trade tensions weighing on global growth materialized in May prompting us to take a more cautious view toward risky assets in the near term. Moreover trade risks are likely to increase in the next weeks on the back of additional U.S. tariffs on the remaining imports from China the latter s more belligerent anti U.S rhetoric and diminishing hopes of a breakthrough at the G 20 meeting later this month. Furthermore U.S. President Trump s inclination to use tariffs to deal with issues beyond trade such as his threat of tariff hikes on Mexico for doing too little to address undocumented immigration into the U.S. contributed to deteriorating market sentiment. Rising odds of a more serious trade war are negative for risky assets since they weigh on the global growth outlook as declining business confidence stunts business investment. Furthermore trade war fears via increased global risk aversion are also undermining our thesis that USD weakness would boost risky assets in the current year. However the downside on EM fixed income has been relatively contained this is more so in hard currency debt than in local currency denominated debt helped by a sharp rally in U.S. Treasuries as the market prices in Fed rate cuts. Credit Monthly Review Concerns around global trade weaker economic growth rising equity volatility and lower risk free yields all contributed to May being a weak month for corporate bonds. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index widened by 17 basis points in May to end the month at 127 basis points over government bonds with longer duration and BBB nonfinancial credits underperforming.7 As measured by excess returns versus government bonds the U.S. investment grade index generated an excess return of 1.39% for the month.8 European investment grade underperformed the U.S. market by widening 20 basis points in May to 127 basis points as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index.9 High yield bonds suffered their largest setback of 2019 in May amid worsening trade tensions and lower Treasury yields and a drop in stocks and oil prices. Spreads widened 74 basis points to end the month at 433 and yields rose 45 basis points to 6.57%.10 Despite the meaningful move wider in spreads total returns were only modestly negative 1.19% last month.11 Outlook While valuations following the widening in May are again attractive absent a recession the risks of recession have increased. The increase in risk premium and wider spreads is reflective of the uncertainty in political policy and weaker growth data. Both of these factors combine to make the short term outlook for corporate earnings less clear. Our base case does not call for a recession rather we expect continued low global growth and low inflation supported by low real rates and easy financial conditions. We are carefully monitoring the incoming economic data with heightened focus on employment trends as well as comments from central banks to see if the central bank economic put will be rekindled such as another targeted longer term refinancing operation TLTRO in Europe which would likely quickly turn market confidence. Technicals remain much improved compared to 2018 and we expect conservative risk positions across the street and steady inflows to credit will keep the risk of forced liquidations low. Securitized Monthly Review The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities MBS Index was up 1.29% in May but significantly underperformed the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Index which returned 2.35% in May as MBS durations shortened as interest rates declined.12 Current coupon agency MBS nominal spreads tightened 3 basis points in May to 85 basis points above interpolated U.S. Treasuries.13 The duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index shortened by nearly a year to 3.38 years during May as mortgage prepayments sped up and are expected to accelerate further as a result of lower mortgage rates.14 National mortgage rates were 6 basis points lower in May ending at 4.03% down 80 basis points from November.15 Lower coupon agency MBS outperformed higher coupon MBS as prepayment concerns have a greater negative impact on the higher coupon securities. The Fed s MBS portfolio shrank by $28 billion during May to $1.555 trillion and is now $82 billion lower year to date.16 Mortgage mutual funds saw net inflows of $0.7 billion in May increasing year to date net inflows to $7.5 billion.17 Mortgage mutual fund inflows in 2019 have essentially matched the 2018 mutual fund outflows of $7.6 billion and have helped partially offset the decline in Fed MBS holdings but overall the Fed s balance sheet MBS reductions significantly outweigh incremental fund inflows and present a headwind for agency MBS valuations in 2019. Outlook We expect credit spreads to continue to drift wider in June mirroring the spread widening in other credit markets although to a lesser extent. While securitized credit spreads are tighter in 2019 they have not tightened nearly as much as other credit markets and are less likely to widen to the same extent. Securitized spreads have generally been less volatile than other credit sectors over the past few years stabilized by continued supportive fundamentals. We believe that securitized fundamental credit conditions will remain positive and that credit sensitive mortgage and securitized assets will continue to perform well. From a fundamental perspective we believe the U.S. economy remains reasonably strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments in our portfolios. Overall we expect agency MBS to continue to underperform in the coming months but we anticipate reducing our agency MBS underweight further if agency MBS continues to underperform. 1 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 2 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 3 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 4 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 5 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 6 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 7 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 8 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 9 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 10 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 11 Source Bloomberg Barclays as of May 31 2019. 12 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 13 Source JP Morgan as of May 31 2019. 14 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 15 Source Bloomberg as of May 31 2019. 16 Source Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of May 31 2019. 17 Source Lipper US Fund Flows data as of May 31 2019. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. The views and opinions expressed are those of the Portfolio Management team as of May 2019 and are subject to change based on market economic and other conditions. Past performance is not indicative of future results. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Well intended policies may have backfired dampening global growth prospects Government policies across markets have recently started to create risks to the global economy. While many were initially motivated by sound reasoning some of these country specific policies have become counterproductive as they have coincided with a dysfunctional U.S. approach to trade. With a layer of U.S. tariff tensions adding stress to markets around the world these various policy induced problems are reinforcing each other to weaken a global economy that should otherwise be growing at a strong pace. U.S. tariffs The dysfunctional policy that gave all the others traction While domestic policies in a number of markets have created incremental headwinds global economic growth might have been strong enough to push through the various national policy induced sources of weakness if it were not for the recent trade tensions. The U.S. approach to trade policy has dampened sentiment hurt U.S. capex and slowed growth prospects around the globe worsening the situation in a number of key economies. Businesses that needed to replace obsolescent capital equipment have become reluctant to embark on large capital expenditures because their global supply chains have become unstable. The uncertainty is causing them to hold off which has negative effects throughout the global economy. As Display 1 shows there is a strong correlation between world trade and earnings per share growth for the MSCI All Country World index. Negative periods in world trade impact corporate profits and slow growth with the reduction of capital expenditures in the United States playing a big part in the mechanism.

The correlation is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the correlation of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. But tariffs are not the only dysfunctional U.S. policy. A combination of very low interest rates and a banking system restrained from making loans has created a bubble in U.S. corporate debt. Keeping interest rates low was supposed to incentivise capital investment but with rates too low for too long it made sense to borrow excessively. Corporations used the cheap loans less productively to buy back shares or pursue M A deals. At the same time the very high capital requirements for the U.S. banking system put in place after the 2008 crisis made it difficult for banks to lend. This reduced debt in the part of the economy without access to other sources of lending such as households but corporations simply turned to the capital markets. In the U.S. total credit to nonfinancial corporations as a percentage of GDP is now higher than at the peak of the financial crisis Display 2 .

See Disclosure section for index definitions. With interest rates still low and likely to rise debt service costs are likely to increase. The coverage ratio has been quite stable for all but the smallest 25% of companies. Among smaller cap companies however interest payment risk is a lot higher and they are the ones that tend to employ most employees.1 China Rebalancing and tripping The Chinese economy has long been heavily reliant on debt. Reducing it is both a sensible policy and a primary concern for the government but its recent attempt to reduce leverage is at the root of the weakness we are currently seeing in China. Total financing growth slowed from 13.4% at the end of December 2017 to 10.2% as of October 2018 and M2 growth2 has moved to a historic low of 8%. But consumer confidence has dropped and household debt has grown to more than 10% of GDP over the last two years as the debt burden shifted onto consumers.3 Display 3 shows how Chinese fixed asset investment has recently declined driven by steep drops in state and infrastructure investment. It also shows how China addressed a similar slowdown in 2015 caused partly by encouraging investors to buy stocks in order to help state owned enterprises refinance with an objective of moving towards a more domestic consumption driven economy through a sharp increase in state investment followed by a big dose of infrastructure spending. However this policy of investment driven growth is exactly what the Chinese government has been trying to move away from. Display 3 Chinese economy hooked on investment stimulus Source National Bureau of Statistics of China Bloomberg as of 27 November 2018. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. These stimulative investments are typically financed through debt issued by the Chinese government or bank loans to corporations spending at the government s request. Either way the investments rely on debt. By slowing investment the government can reduce debt unfortunately this also slows economic growth widens debt spreads and makes it more difficult for private entities to refinance. Long term China does need to reduce its debt and with a backdrop of strong global economic growth its rebalancing would have been less painful. Unfortunately its aggressive move to reduce leverage created significant weakness at the same time that trade tensions dampened sentiment and slowed growth prospects around the globe worsening China s situation. Europe A menu of mistakes It is not difficult to find dysfunctional policies in Europe with all four of the continent s largest economies subject to regulatory or political headwinds that are amplified by global trade troubles UK The Brexit vote has created enormous uncertainty about the future of Britain and its ties to trading partners with business investment contracting by 1.2% in Q3.4 Global companies that need trading links to the rest of Europe such as banks are re evaluating whether they want to be in Britain at all. Italy A populist government is aiming to reinstate many of the fiscally unsustainable policies that previous governments only managed to reduce with great difficulty. This has pushed up spreads in European and Italian bonds raising funding costs generating uncertainty and weakening the economy. France Social unrest over living costs has led to the worst riots since 1968 undermining President Macron s longer term ability to implement pro growth reforms. Germany Politics are also frustrating Germany precisely when it needs stability to deal with trade related headwinds. It is facing the growth of a populist right wing element a polarisation of the electorate on left and right and Chancellor Merkel stepping down in 2021. She has been a stabilising force not only in Germany but more broadly in Europe for a long time. Much of the downturn in Germany has been driven by a pullback in car sales as Europe s car sector was hit by both the slowdown in China and new European emissions testing rules. Auto sales in China were down 12% and Germany s terms of trade have fallen 6.2% year over year the sharpest decline since the early 2000s. Meanwhile domestic European car registrations fell 7.3% in October following a 23.5% decline in September.

Their quantitative easing programme was intended to restart the economy but its size and pegged rates have made it difficult to unwind without causing significant volatility. A tax increase planned for October 2019 could also turn out to have negative impacts if we see a repeat of Japan s 2014 tax hike which was announced too far in advance and caused unnecessary uncertainty. Here policymakers seemed to have learned from past mistakes and this time the government has plans to mitigate the impact on consumers such as hike exemptions on basic food items and pressure on providers to reduce wireless service charges. Moreover forward earnings expectations are improving noticeably suggesting Japanese equities look more attractive at least as long as the Japanese Central Bank continues its QE programme. Emerging markets On the receiving end Emerging markets have generally been on the receiving end of policies implemented in the developed world but there are a few exceptions. Following its cancellation of a major airport construction project investors have become concerned that the new Mexican government may be relatively unfriendly to business but it is still too early to judge how policies will evolve. Venezuela and Argentina have consistent policy based difficulties. However the bulk of policy dysfunction is focused on developed markets along with China. Trends into 2019 A way out The keystone of the policy induced weakness going into 2019 has been the U.S. approach to trade. After the recent G20 meeting in Argentina Presidents Trump and Xi agreed to postpone any tariff escalation during a 90 day negotiation period. Despite the positive news we believe this is more showmanship than substance with tensions remaining high. To some extent the Chinese are willing to give the impression that the tariffs are impacting their economy more strongly than may actually be the case. By giving the tariffs credit for weakness caused by their aggressive deleveraging they can deflect public concern about weakness grown from their own policies to Trump s highly visible tariff pressure. In order of political likelihood we see three potential upside catalysts that might restimulate the global economy A more dovish Fed and or a significant fiscal stimulus A significant infrastructure spending package in the U.S. is one of the few initiatives supported by both Democrats and Republicans. It could create a more supportive global backdrop for China s rebalancing act and have significant positive ramifications for the U.S. A targeted Chinese stimulus programme China has not yet undertaken a stimulus programme because it would run counter to the government s goal of debt reduction but it may be considering a targeted programme enough to offset the weakness from deleveraging but not so strong as to lead to another counterproductive ramp up in debt levels. We believe the size and likelihood of this happening depends to some extent on the tariff situation. In any case we expect a less aggressive deleveraging strategy for the moment when growth is slowing Easing of trade tensions Genuine positive developments in the U.S. China tariffs negotiation would allow businesses to restart their investment programs and remove the primary stressor on the global economy. In the absence of a positive stimulus of this sort 2019 is likely to see continued weakness from policy until prices get to a point where valuations become attractive enough to spur demand. In most regions we see valuations close to their fair value but in the U.S. we still see about 4% or 5% more downside before we hit neutral levels. With the discrepancy between U.S. and European forward PE at the 97th percentile for the first time since the financial crisis we may see more forward looking downside risk in the U.S. than in Europe and the rest of the world. Looking forward Equities While in 2018 U.S. assets were the most compelling investment in hindsight in 2019 we expect to find more investment opportunities outside of the U.S. Valuations and sentiment are more attractive in ex U.S. asset classes we expect the US dollar to turn from a tailwind to a headwind for investors and most importantly the U.S. is likely to lose its earnings and growth advantage. In other words we are likely to see more synchronised GDP and earnings growth in 2019 than we did in 2018. Despite attractive relative valuations and negative investor sentiment towards European equities however we are not ready to re initiate an overweight position. Our key concern stems from what we view as still too bullish earnings expectations in the eurozone. Twelve month forward earnings expectations currently stand at 9.5% but sales are only expected to grow at 3.7% and core inflation is likely to accelerate driven by rising wages.5 A potential upside surprise could be the resolution of political concerns but this is not our base case. A second potential positive would be a resumption of growth in European auto sales to China that could occur if the Chinese government eases up on deleveraging. Consequently we maintain an equal weight allocation to U.S. and eurozone equities with an underweight to U.S. technology stocks. 2019 will likely be another challenging year for equity markets and we think positioning should be framed more in the context of sector level opportunities and style tilts than country bets. We also expect to find potential opportunities within oversold emerging market equities. At the same time with valuations more reasonable and the positive potential catalysts above it makes sense to cautiously increase equity exposure as forward looking volatility is unlikely to be as high as it has been in the recent past. Looking forward Fixed Income Strong U.S. growth in 2018 led to a significant repricing of U.S. Treasuries. The 10 year Treasury yield has gone up by about 50bps year to date but with U.S. growth likely to reverse towards a medium trend of around 2% per year we feel the upside and downside risks are somewhat in balance.6 Given their recent sharp downward adjustment however we maintain our underweight stance on Treasuries. In Europe we have seen downside surprises to economic growth due to a confluence of negative factors. While some of these factors such as Italian budget negotiation and Brexit are likely to drag on for longer the impact of other factors such as emission regulation changes and a sharp reduction in auto sales should abate. The recovery in European economic activity is negative for euro government bonds. In the meantime the ECB is likely to complete the QE programme and cease further balance sheet expansion. The extremely low yields from the likes of German bunds offer an unattractive risk return proposition given the upside risk to yields. We continue to hold an underweight view on German bonds. Similar to euro government bonds we are negative on Japanese government bonds JGBs . There is limited upside from JGBs where the 10 year yield is less than 10bps. The potential relaxation of yield curve control by the Bank of Japan could lead to markedly adverse movements in yields and hence capital loss. Within developed market credit we are putting a greater focus on quality given that we expect the recent widening in spreads to continue in 2019. A deteriorating profile for earnings in both the U.S. and Europe is likely to weigh on high yield credit. Moreover given rising hedging costs and the prospect of US dollar weakness in 2019 we have a relative preference for European over U.S. credit. From our perspective one of the best opportunities in fixed income lies within emerging market debt. The asset class should benefit from the trends discussed above namely weakening U.S. growth a more dovish Fed and downside in the US dollar. Investors cautiously returning Counterproductive government policies across a number of markets have weakened the global economy. Many started with sound intentions some outlived their usefulness and all were exacerbated by the trade war. This conjunction of dysfunctional policies has created a lot of volatility and corrected much of the excesses in pricing with valuations outside the U.S. getting close to a point where investors might start looking to invest cautiously back in the market. Forward looking volatility is unlikely to be as high as it has been in the recent past. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  In this slow grinding economic cycle markets have experienced a series of recession scares. Yet the Applied Equity Advisor team is not in the recession camp. Andrew Slimmon maintains that the U.S. stock market will break out during the fourth quarter of 2019 with the S P 500 ending the year well north of 3 000. This is despite the fact that the current market is range bound and a level of fear is palpable. As was the case in Q1 2009 fund flows are currently negative sentiment figures are dour and the valuation spread between the perceived safe and cyclical stocks is hugely distorted. Sentiment is consistent with a bear market low not a bull market peak. But in 2009 the market exhibited a significant recovery despite the negativity and Slimmon expects similarly at the end of 2019. However the inverted yield curve should not be ignored an indication of potential problems for the economy in 2021. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The July European Central Bank ECB monetary policy meeting pretty much confirmed that policy is likely to be eased in September. The interim period will be used to build a consensus in the Governing Council around what exactly the policy response should be. Guided by some pretty explicit language in the statement our expectation is for the ECB to announce a package of easing measures most likely including rate cuts changes to its forward guidance renewed quantitative easing QE and mitigating measures to offset some of the cost of more negative interest rates on the banking sector. While the main measures may be easy to anticipate the unexpected details may matter more the ECB under Draghi has excelled at surprising the market with its dovishness by coming up with policy measures that few anticipated we expect the same at his swan song. This ECB meeting was important because it confirmed a shift in monetary policy bias which President Mario Draghi signalled at Sintra in mid June. In that speech he stated that In the absence of improvement additional stimulus will be required a clear indication that the ECB was far closer to easing monetary policy than previously thought. Prior to that it stood ready to act only if things got worse now he was saying things needed to get better for the ECB NOT to act. It was not definite following that speech if ECB policy had changed as several Governing Council members gave speeches or interviews which suggested easing would only happen if things got worse. However the July ECB meeting confirmed that unless things got suddenly better an agreement to ease policy was reached even if there was no agreement yet on what exactly those easing measures should be. It seems that once again Mario Draghi has moved ahead of the rest of the Governing Council and then pulled it in line with his thinking. So what caused the ECB to change its position and what policy options are likely The reason for the change is not immediately obvious because the recent Eurozone macroeconomic environment while not exactly flourishing has not been struggling too badly. The manufacturing sector is weak but the labour market and construction sectors remain strong. We think the change comes from three factors first Eurozone core inflation has failed to pick up despite the fact that the labour market has tightened and wage growth has been robust for some time now second both survey and market based measures of medium term inflation expectations i.e. inflation breakevens have fallen this year casting doubt about whether the ECB can achieve its inflation mandate third the ECB continues to worry about international geopolitical and trade risks which pose hard to predict downside threats to the Eurozone economy. As Draghi stated explicitly the ECB is currently failing on its inflation mandate and is increasingly not expected to achieve it any time soon all while the economy is not getting better. The Governing Council does not like what it sees. So the ECB needs to act not only because it is failing to meet its inflation mandate and believing risks are skewed to the downside but also because it is concerned about losing credibility as a central bank that specifically targets inflation. This is slightly different to the situation in which the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed finds itself where moderate inflation gives it leeway to ease if it wants. For the ECB weak inflation is forcing it to act. In terms of policy response we think the ECB is likely to announce a package of easing measures in September. This is something it has favoured doing in the past as a collection of complimentary policy initiatives is more effective than a piecemeal approach. It is debateable whether the ECB has a big policy bazooka left so getting the most out of the tools it does have is important and getting maximum bang for the buck involves combining them. Given the details given in July s announcement the package we envision is A 20 basis point cut in the Deposit rate rate cuts were not mentioned in July s release but the ECB hasn t pushed back on the market pricing in of cuts and the mention of mitigating measures see below suggests they are likely. In our mind cutting by less than 20 basis points achieves little and cutting more may be counterproductive due to the negative impact on the banking sector. Rate cuts are the conventional tool for central banks to stimulate the economy and Draghi has highlighted their effectiveness in the Eurozone given their impact on the currency i.e. rate cuts should provide additional stimulus and inflationary pressure if they cause the euro to depreciate. Changes to forward guidance the guidance the ECB provides on when it plans to change interest rates and other policy settings in the future is a key tool as it enables it to influence interest rates across the yield curve. As in the past it may be combined with QE and other measures e.g. the ECB will not raise interest rates until after it has finished new QE purchases . A resumption of the QE programme July s statement referred to options for the size and composition of potential new asset purchases. So we do not only expect a resumption of quantitative easing but changes to the parameters of the previous programme as well. An increase in individual issuer limits to 40% or 50% will be necessary to make a new programme credibly large but we will also be keeping an eye out for any innovative additions to purchases like senior bank debt. Mitigating measures to offset the rate cuts it is estimated that the negative interest rates banks currently earn on their ECB deposits actually costs them EUR 8 billion per year although the cost falls mainly on northern European banks rather than being evenly spread across the system as a whole. A tiering system whereby a higher rate is paid on some initial portion of a bank s excess reserves would alleviate some of the cost although the programme would need to be carefully designed not to raise money market interest rates which would reduce the effect of cutting rates. Something else the ECB under Draghi has excelled at developing innovative policy initiatives. His reputation for surprising the market primarily comes from designing policy measures investors didn t anticipate rather than doing more of what they were expecting. We re not quite sure what the ECB might pull out of its bag of tricks this time but we wouldn t be surprised to see something different from just vanilla rate cuts more QE and forward guidance. If we re correct about our expectations what do we think the impact on fixed income markets is likely to be The market has already priced in more than 20 basis points of rate cuts by the end of 2020 so we think the fall in the yield of German government bunds and other high quality government issuers is limited even if they are once again supported by renewed ECB buying. However we expect euro sovereign spreads to tighten as yieldhungry investors are forced into holding lower rated paper. Sovereign spreads have already tightened significantly this year for example 10 year Spanish bonos now only yield 70 basis points more than German bunds down from nearly 130 basis points in early January. However the fiscal fundamentals of most of these countries have also been improving justifying tighter spreads. We think there is more to go. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  On the road again I just can t wait to get on the road again. Johnny Cash After months of market jitters rallies and global growth concerns fiscal stimulus could provide a boost that puts the economy on the road again. Weakness in financial markets has generally led central banks to adopt a more dovish attitude most notably reflected in the recent US rate hike pause. However we believe that fiscal stimulus programmes many of which include large infrastructure spending initiatives could be key to reducing the risk of recession in the near term. We expect further fiscal stimulus announcements from China the US and the Eurozone meaning that by the second half of 2019 we could see a cyclical upswing in infrastructure investment which would go into 2020. China Let the building begin China s long term goal of reducing leverage and improving industries efficiencies has resulted in an economic slowdown and rising unemployment. The situation has been exacerbated by trade tensions with the U.S. leading to some signs of social unrest. In part to alleviate any potential tension the Chinese government has started stimulating in a significant way showing a strong commitment to stabilising their economy in the short term. To jump start the economy China is initiating a two pronged fiscal stimulus programme focused on tax cuts and local government debt financed infrastructure projects. We expect the augmented fiscal deficit which includes local government financing vehicles and other off budget activity to be 1.5%1 higher than 2018. At the same time we have seen significant monetary easing such as reserve requirement ratio RRR cuts and more targeted credit support to the private sector. If China s recent push on both the monetary and fiscal fronts helps it stabilise at the announced 6% to 6.5%2 expected growth rate for 2019 then this should filter through to the rest of the world particularly to Asia ex Japan. United States building bridges Bipartisan support for infrastructure With a divided Congress the U.S. is in a political stalemate. But one of the areas where a bipartisan agreement seems possible is infrastructure spending. Due to decades of neglect U.S. infrastructure is in desperate need of an upgrade garnering a D rating from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017.3 Infrastructure spending would likely create jobs and improve the economy. It could also reduce transportation costs and increase safety leading to higher profitability for businesses which would then have the wherewithal to boost investment. President Trump proposed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package in 2018 intended mainly to modernise aging roads bridges and airports. The Democrats have disclosed their own plans to spend $500 billion over 10 years focused on infrastructure that would reduce fossil fuel dependence. The most promising means of paying for an infrastructure package would be raising the gasoline tax which has not been raised since the Clinton administration by 25 cents per gallon over five years. Other avenues for funding include increasing the deficit cutting other areas of the budget a vehicle mileage tax or a financial transactions tax. While the two parties plans differ in detail there is already powerful voter support from both Republicans and Democrats for passing an infrastructure bill in some form Display 1 . With support at 87% from likely voters 4 we expect a joint bill will be introduced in May. DISPLAY 1 U.S. voters approve of infrastructure spending Source Poll was conducted 23 24 January 2019 by Rasmussen Reports for the American Road Transportation Builders Association ARTBA and American Public Transportation Association APTA . Results were consistent across voters who identified as Republican and Democrat. Europe Stimulus led by Italy and Germany In the eurozone as a whole fiscal stimulus for 2019 is nowhere near that of China or the U.S. but it is nevertheless expansionary. With ageing infrastructure across the Continent European governments look like they will adopt stimulus programmes of approximately $47 billion cumulatively. Our belief is that these eurozone stimulus programmes are in part a reaction to the rise of the populist parties in countries like Italy. Populism has led to a rebellion against austerity. It also appears to have pushed more mainstream political parties towards greater spending to improve their economies and protect their political positions. Spending levels differ significantly among eurozone countries. Italy has increased its structural primary surplus the most by 18 billion Display 2 . Germany has been running a surplus so it has more leeway to stimulate. By contrast France and Spain have come under political pressure to abandon their attempts to keep deficits below the 3% threshold. The French government was forced by protesters to scrap some planned tax increases and the Spanish government failed to get its budget through parliament. Such pressures may result in more expansionary measures so we may actually see the net number surpassing the projected $47 billion. DISPLAY 2 Big spenders Italy Germany Source European Commission MSIM. As of 6 March 2019. Japan Infrastructure spending to offset VAT Japan will raise its VAT from 8% to 10% in October 2019 to help finance ballooning social security costs. The last time the VAT was increased in 2014 it caused a noticeable slowdown in the Japanese economy a risk the government is clearly aware of and is taking action to pre empt. Specific actions include pressuring businesses to increase wages and to offset the tax increase a record budget for 2019 that includes 2 trillion yen to be spent on measures such as shopping vouchers for low income households and 500 billion yen in state subsidies to encourage cashless transactions. It is worth noting that the budget includes about 1 trillion yen designated for public works essentially infrastructure projects. These spending initiatives add up to about 6.5 trillion yen while the tax revenue increase from the VAT is projected to be 5.6 trillion yen so the net effect is 0.9 trillion yen of positive stimulus approximately $9.8 bn or 0.16% of GDP. Therefore we believe the strong commitment to avoiding a repeat of 2014 should help Japan s domestic economy to navigate the tax hike. Emerging Markets Fiscally expansive overall with a focus on infrastructure Despite variance among countries there is a consistent theme of positive fiscal stimulus particularly infrastructure spending in most emerging markets Emerging Asia The region is strongly positive overall. India is undertaking spending on roads railroads and rural development as well as welfare spending on farm income support and tax relief. The Philippines is also increasing spending and raising its budget deficit ceiling to boost infrastructure. In South Korea the government is pursuing the largest budget increase since the 2008 financial crisis up 9.5% from last year primarily in response to economic weakness in China. Taiwan s spending remains neutral while Indonesia is one of the region s outliers having postponed infrastructure projects. Latin America Overall the region is positive on infrastructure spending but with net fiscal tightening. In Brazil the government has an incredibly strong pipeline for infrastructure spending including 12 airports and a major rail line. It will auction four port leases in March while monetary policy has eased. The new president has brightened the investment outlook though some in the market have governance concerns. In Mexico where decade high interest rates serve to dampen ambitious plans infrastructure spending remains neutral. Eastern Europe Middle East and Africa Russia has launched a development fund for co financing infrastructure projects which is a positive step. However the latest sanctions threaten to inhibit investment. DISPLAY 3 Inferring from China s experience Forecasts estimates are based on current market conditions subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass. Source IBES Datastream MSIM. Beta calculated using monthly data between February 2011 February 2018 Implications Beneficiaries of infrastructure spending For investors infrastructure spending has implications across various sectors. To infer what those implications might be we can look at China s experience with its recent stimulus programme. Display 3 shows the effect of stimulus on China s credit impulse expectations year over year for various sectors. It suggests energy materials and industrials sectors may have the most upside for equity investors. We are also constructive on industrial metals due to their importance in infrastructure in spite of their low ranking in this table. From a fixed income point of view stimulative policies suggest a positive outlook for global growth and a bottoming out of recent weakness. While short term weakness in economic data and a dovish Fed may cause bond yields to drop our view is that the return to owning longer dated bonds relative to the risk remains unattractive. The flatness of the yield curve means that any evidence of renewed growth due for example to a significant US infrastructure stimulus programme could lead to a sharp rebound in yields and negative returns to longer dated bonds from current levels. Fiscal stimulus would also suggest greater bond issuance which would likely drive yields higher. Our outlook is for a stronger economy possibly a modest increase in inflationary expectations and a greater supply of debt all of which is negative for long duration bonds. Major risk events could change our outlook What complicates this generally positive outlook for infrastructure and the sectors that stand to benefit from it is an unusually large number of binary risk events that could temporarily setback the markets and dampen the enthusiasm for fiscal stimulus. We would use these more as buying opportunities than commitments to negative positions. These risks are outlined in Display 4. These binary risks are mostly skewed to the downside.

Let the builders build The renewed focus on infrastructure is a global trend. Even in Japan where overall fiscal spending is down infrastructure spending is marginally higher Display 5 . New projects in the form of roads bridges improved transportation hubs rural development and many other initiatives are likely to minimise the threat of a recession. In fact we think it could get the global economy back on the road again headed toward a meaningful cyclical upswing going into 2020.

Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Our worries that the rally in risk assets would struggle without concrete improvement in economic fundamentals proved partly true. Government bonds rallied massively as more central banks turned dovish and economic data did not inspire. However despite this headwind of lower government bond yields implying concern about the economic future risk assets held up well investment grade spreads narrowed while high yield marginally underperformed. Optimism that an easier lower path of monetary policy in 2019 and lower real short and long term yields will support economies and lengthen the business cycle despite continued generally disappointing data abounds.

Fixed Income Outlook Reduced concerns about overly aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve Fed tightening and withdrawal of stimulus from other central banks are now consensus. To be fair only the Fed has definitely said they have no plans to ease they view themselves as being truly on hold. This to us is the conundrum. Market pricing of the Fed looks a tad optimistic or pessimistic if you re thinking about the economy meaning too high a probability is being attached to the Fed actually cutting rates. That makes us cautious about the direction of yields and worried that some upward adjustment is coming. On the other hand clear global central bank concern about economic weakness and desultory inflation behavior suggests optimism that rates will stay low indefinitely implying lower long term yields. What is unambiguous is that this combo is good for risk assets. We re constructive on corporate credit emerging markets and securitized debt but not as bullish as we were the beginning of the year. By contrast we think the outlook for developed economy government bonds is more challenging and are modestly underweight duration even though central banks have pivoted towards a more dovish stance. These paradoxes can be partly explained by what financial markets have already priced in and by our expectations for the global economy going forward. While there can be no doubting that central banks concerned about the slowing global economy and facing little pressure to tighten policy due to weak inflationary pressures have become more dovish we think this is now generally in the price and sometimes even more than that. While we agree the Fed may not raise rates further in 2019 the market is pricing in rate cuts. In euro the European Central Bank ECB has pushed out its guidance on rate hikes into next year but the market is not pricing increases until 2021. With valuations already rich and carry declining due to flattening yield curves the return outlook for high quality government bonds has become relatively unattractive unless one believes rate cuts are coming. However the accommodative monetary policy shift will still provide a supportive environment for emerging markets and corporate credit. In addition to monetary policy Chinese fiscal and other economic stimulus measures should help buoy the global economy given China s importance as a source of external demand in many developing and European economies. From a technical perspective the ongoing lack of market volatility makes carry trades attractive. A further source of positive impetus could be a resolution of the U.S. China trade dispute. While the current economic data is still not strong the trajectory is positive. We also remain positive on securitized product given the health of the household sector in developed economies and accommodative monetary policy. While the temporary inversion of the U.S. yield curve rekindled discussion of an approaching U.S. recession the curve has since re steepened and it has also been pointed out that the time from curve inversion to recession has been long and variable. Significant risks still persist notably from trade and Brexit and many of last year s idiosyncratic emerging market risks have not disappeared either. However the main reason we are less bullish on risky assets than we were a few months ago is due to valuations being less attractive following the strong performance in the first quarter of the year. We have therefore taken steps to de risk portfolios taking advantage of strong market conditions which are consistent with inflows into credit product. Developed Market Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In March risk asset returns lost momentum as government bonds rallied but we would argue did better than anticipated as a result of stronger market confidence in the central bank pivot to a more dovish policy stance. Sovereign bond yields across the developed markets saw significant declines over the month with yields hitting multiyear lows. Central banks became even less hawkish as they responded to ongoing weakness in the global economy in addition to weak inflationary pressures. The Fed pivoted to a much more dovish stance projecting no rate hikes for the remainder of 2019. The USD modestly weakened during March particularly against the EUR JPY and GBP. The ECB announced new stimulus in the form of a long term loans program for banks which removed a funding risk from when the current programs expire. Outlook Recent speeches from the Fed policymakers give us further confidence that the Fed is committed to being patient and flexible regarding future rate hikes. At this point it is not likely the Fed will hike rates again in 2019 but it may also not cut as much as the market currently prices. We expect Bank of Japan BoJ policy to remain easy along with other major central bank policies but the BoJ may be uncomfortable with 10 year JGB yields falling below 0.10%. In terms of currencies we expect the USD to weaken modestly in 2019. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income asset returns were mixed in the month as EM currencies weakened versus the USD while local bond performance and external debt returns were positive. Within the hard currency segment investment grade outperformed high yield as U.S. Treasury yields fell in the period and sovereigns outperformed corporates.1 Commodity prices were also mixed in the period with continued strength in oil prices while precious metals and agricultural commodity prices declined.2 Investment flows continued their positive momentum with $16 billion flowing into EM fixed income funds during the month according to JP Morgan. The inflows were roughly split between institutional and retail flows primarily in favor of hard currency strategies followed by local currency and then blended. Outlook Despite recent softness in global growth and potentially market disruptive events in the near term most notably Brexit our outlook for EM debt remains constructive due to several factors. Firstly global monetary policy has decidedly turned accommodative as emphasized by the recent dovish turn by the Fed and an easing bias by the ECB. In addition China continues to provide significant stimulus via monetary easing through reserve requirement ratio RRR cuts and enlarged liquidity facilities and fiscal expansion via tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending by local governments . Thirdly the U.S. China trade conflict a major source of uncertainty last year appears to be heading toward a provisionary agreement in the next few months potentially boosting sentiment for risky assets in the near term. Credit Monthly Review Despite the precipitous drop in government bond yields and mixed economic data the rally in corporate bonds barely paused enabling the year to date rally to continue. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index narrowed by 1 basis point in March to end the month at 119 basis points over government bonds. European investment grade performed even better in March closing the gap on year to date performance versus the U.S. spreads with the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index tightening by 6 basis points to end March at 121 basis points relative to government bonds. The U.S. high yield market continued to rally in March and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Index produced total returns of 0.94 percent.3 Spreads widened 14 basis points to end the month at 414 basis points while yields decreased by 11 basis points to 6.43 percent.4 Outlook Credit markets had a lot to digest in March. Economic data continued to come in mixed especially outside the U.S. but seemed to indicate that the worst of the slowdown is now behind us. Our bias to position portfolios long risk coming into 2019 has been and should continue to be rewarded. Securitized Monthly Review Mortgage and securitized markets are off to a good start in 2019 benefitting from both rallying interest rates and tightening spreads. We believe that fundamental credit conditions will remain positive and that credit sensitive mortgage and securitized assets will continue to perform well. From a fundamental perspective we believe the U.S. economy is strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments. We are underweight agency mortgage backed securities MBS due to potential supply headwinds that the sector could face as the Fed has ended its MBS purchases and U.S. banks could potentially reduce their agency MBS holdings if their risk based capital requirements are eased. Outlook We continue to expect a benign rate volatility environment for 2019 which should benefit agency MBS in 2019 but some of this upside could be offset by the supply pressure from the Fed balance sheet runoff. Overall we expect agency MBS to continue to outperform Treasuries but underperform credit oriented securitized opportunities. In light of this strong performance and as first mentioned last month we continue to take steps to de risk most portfolios by trimming a mixture of subordinated financials BBB non financials high yield and convertible bonds. We still find credit attractive at these levels but we believe the bulk of capital gains for the year are likely behind us. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Without it all else fails Governance refers to how well a company is managed and to the oversight of its management. Without such good governance there is no assurance that management will promote innovation preserve intangible assets reinvest profits or allocate capital wisely. Though somewhat counterintuitive we see governance as more important for the high quality companies we focus on than for other companies. This is partly because management has more degrees of freedom when overseeing strong cash flow and intangible assets. Three main risks can arise from poor governance short termism capital misallocation and excessive risk taking. Short termism Management teams may prioritize short term measures over longer term success. This may be an excessive fixation on quarterly results revenue growth or this year s earnings per share. The end result is destruction of long term compounding power. The problem is even worse if the short termism is encouraged by poorly structured incentive schemes. Managing a business for the long term confers huge advantages. Companies with a short term perspective lose touch with their stakeholders and are not sustainable. Eventually their return generating potential becomes curtailed. Witness the lack of innovation that led to the demise of Polaroid Blockbuster Kodak Nokia or Blackberry. Consider the challenges facing a company that finds itself shadowed by the dark cloak of a major internet retailer and struggles to become digitally relevant. For high quality companies earnings can be easy to massage. For instance consumer staples companies tend to have large advertising budgets. Management can trim these costs to inflate short term profits but failure to promote the business comes at a cost of the franchise later. Capital misallocation A further threat comes in the allocation of capital. Investing capital at low returns either through paying too much for acquisitions or expanding into lower return businesses can undermine the overall quality of the business and impair its ability to compound over time. For high quality high return companies the high levels of free cash flow give rise to temptations for misallocation. Excessive risk taking Finally poor governance may lead to excessive risk taking. High quality companies have more to lose in this regard simply because the greater value of the franchise means there is more at stake. For example misconduct in environmental and social issues two ESG pillars could be more likely if a company is not grounded in the third pillar governance. We think our focus on governance has led to a portfolio of companies whose management have relatively long term perspectives are judicious risk managers and allocate capital better than the market as a whole.

      "Doc - Orig:  The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose... Douglas Adams Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency We know that life depends on water. What might be a surprise is the amount of economic activity that is also reliant on water a lot of water. Water is not just for human hydration and agriculture but a critical component in the manufacturing processes of countless everyday products such as smartphones and jeans. The high usage and scarcity of water have become a consequential issue not only for human health but for the global economy. In this piece we illustrate the impact of water stress on some important industries and encourage investors not only to consider water issues as part of their investment decisions but to engage companies on those water issues affecting their businesses and supply chains. According to the World Economic Forum s Global Risk Report 2019 the water crisis is now the fourth greatest global societal risk 1 defined as a significant decline in the available quality and quantity of fresh water resulting in harmful effects on human health and or economic activity. Environmental concerns continue to dominate global risks. Water stress is rising Water use has been increasing worldwide by about 1% per year since the 1980s Display 1 .2 While there is enough water in the world to satisfy current demand it is often suboptimally located where local supply solutions are potentially expensive and problematic. Today due to a geographic mismatch between availability and demand over two billion people live in countries under high water stress and about four billion experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. By 2050 global water demand is expected to have grown by 20% to 30%3 from current levels with the ability to meet that demand made worse by deteriorating water quality. The worldwide consequences of insufficient safe drinking water range from child mortality 4 to gender inequality 5 to mass migrations triggered by water scarcity. Water stress has the potential to affect a broad range of businesses globally. Display 1 Global water stress levels differ across regions Physical water stress is defined here as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn annually by all major sectors including environmental water requirements to the total amount of renewable freshwater resources expressed as a percentage.

Reprinted with the permission of the United Nations. ... and this water stress threatens a number of industries FOOD BEVERAGE AND AGRICULTUREAgriculture accounts for 69% of global fresh water use.6 The water demands of agriculture make the entire food and beverage supply chain highly sensitive to water stress. As Display 2 shows a single kilo of beef takes over 15 000 litres of water to produce based on irrigating the crops that the animals eat providing drinking water and hosing down factory farms transport trucks and abattoirs. Similarly a kilo of nuts uses around 9 000 litres of water such that California dedicates roughly 10% of its water supply just for growing almonds.7 Furthermore agriculture related water stress is not limited to food production. For example it takes 9 500 litres of water to produce a single pair of jeans based on growing the cotton used washing it and dyeing it. Not all businesses are prepared to deal with water stress whether it impacts them directly or further along their supply chains. The yields of many crops used in the food and beverage industry are likely to fall as temperatures rise but only 40% of beverage companies have developed programmes to optimise water usage and only 24% of food companies report efforts to manage water stress in their supply chains.8 At the other end of the spectrum there are companies in the industry targeting 100% water re usage rates by 2020. Display 2 Agriculture consumes huge amounts of water Source www.waterfootprint.org en resources interactive tools product gallery Mekonnen M.M. and Hoekstra A.Y. 2012 A global assessment of the water footprint of farm animal products Ecosystems 15 3 401 415 OIL AND GAS USING WATER FOR EXTRACTION Oil and gas companies face similar challenges related to environmental and community impact and related costs often not planned for in initial project financing as well as reputational and regulatory risks. Water management costs can reach 15% of total well costs.9 Hydraulic fracturing fracking is particularly fraught as it requires high pressure water mixed with chemicals and sand to extract shale oil while 38% of these projects worldwide are located in arid areas. The issue is aggravated by the fact that contaminated water is often a byproduct of fracking introducing connected disposal issues.6 10 UTILITIES RISKING DISRUPTIONS 90% of global power production is dependent on water 11 whether for raw material extraction powering turbines cooling thermal processes or cleaning emissions and 47% of global thermal power plant capacity coal natural gas and nuclear is in regions already experiencing water stress.12 Poor water management and unsustainable rates of water consumption increase the risk of operational disruptions and regulatory water withdrawal limits.13 These disruptions can not only lead to a loss of revenue but often require additional investment in infrastructure such as desalinisation plants or air cooling that are often excluded from the initial project financing. And while these companies may reduce their exposure to water scarcity risk the connected trade off is that these strategies often result in an increase in energy intensity. SEMICONDUCTORS A GROWING THIRST FOR ULTRA PURE WATER The semiconductor industry may not appear to be an obvious candidate for water concerns but the production of wafers the thin layers that are used to make integrated circuits requires massive amounts of ultrapure water UPW to rinse every layer. UPW is simply hyper purified water needed to meet the industry s stringent manufacturing requirements. A typical semiconductor manufacturing facility uses two to four million gallons of UPW per day. In the industry water withdrawal intensity on average grew at a 2.1% compound annual growth rate between 2014 and 2016.14 Additionally semiconductor companies have historically incurred clean up costs connected to groundwater contamination of up to $100 million per incident.15 While the main solution appears to be water recycling recycling rates for processed water in the industry range from as high as 80% mainly in Asia to as low as 10%. It is interesting to note that the production of a single iPhone requires 14 500 litres of water 16 reinforcing the idea that semiconductors should feature prominently in any discussion of industries facing potential challenges from water scarcity and stress. How water scarcity informs our top down macro views As managers of top down macro driven multi asset strategies we have often discussed infrastructure spending as a contributor to global economic growth this also links to water scarcity as water infrastructure projects worldwide are expected to see annual growth of 5% 8%.16 The economic benefits of access to clean water and sanitation are estimated to outweigh their costs by a factor of 5.5 to 1.17 In the U.S. the rapidly decaying infrastructure of water systems is bringing dangerous levels of lead and other contaminants into homes. Every $1 invested in basic drinking water produces medical cost savings and increased productivity amounting to an average of more than $3 in urban areas and $7 in rural areas. For every $1 invested in basic sanitation the returns are $2.5 urban and $5 rural .18 We believe that the approval in 2019 of a significant U.S. infrastructure package which could include spending on water infrastructure remains a possibility. Water scarcity as an input into our investment process When constructing global multi asset portfolios we can use scores on companies ESG19 performance provided by specialist ESG data providers who can identify the leaders and laggards in water stress exposure and risk management analysing factors such as water recycling rates consumption reduction targets and investment in water infrastructure. For example companies that implement sustainable water usage solutions can ease the stress on local communities reduce the risk of unexpected disruptions to their operations and mitigate financial and reputational risks. They may even reduce costs for example recycling the water used in mining can generate savings of more than $1 per barrel of oil. Among utilities natural gas wind and solar have significantly lower water intensities than nuclear and coal so some utilities are transitioning towards these less water intensive approaches to reduce their long term risk exposure to water scarcity. A second way in which an understanding of water scarcity can benefit our portfolios is through our approach to engaging with the companies in which we invest Engaging in a targeted way to encourage water stewardship and to evaluate water metrics and conservation policies can provide valuable insights into the risks and opportunities that companies face Monitoring the water footprint in all steps of a company s supply chain can give us a better understanding of inefficiencies and viable improvements Encouraging companies to improve the quality of their disclosure on water management for example by participating in the Carbon Disclosure Project annual water survey Ensuring companies follow the relevant water stewardship code for their industry Spillover effects of water management Clean Water and Sanitation is one of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals SDGs a call to action to end poverty protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. By addressing water issues companies and countries can also better manage other SDGs including food energy health and wellbeing gender equality and work and economic growth. As Douglas Adams wrote in Dirk Gently s Holistic Detective Agency interconnections can be both subtle and complex. There is not an aggregate water shortage on the planet but water scarcity and quality at the local level are serious problems that affect many industries. As investors we necessarily consider these risks in making investment decisions for our portfolios. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  There s an old golf joke A con artist and his 800 pound gorilla convince an unsuspecting golfer into $1 000 bet that he can t beat the gorilla in a round of golf. The confident golfer accepts the bet and then stares in disbelief as the gorilla hits a 420 yard drive six inches from the pin on the first hole. The con artist chuckles and says I told you this gorilla can golf. Look you seem like a nice guy. Give me $500 and I ll call the bet off. The relieved golfer accepts and agrees to finish the round for fun. As they walk up the first fairway the golfer asks By the way how does the gorilla putt The con artist responds Same as he drives. Straight as an arrow and 400 yards As every golfer knows you can t hit every shot the same way. Woods are often used from the tee box irons in the fairway wedges from the sand putters on the green. But what if your ball is sitting in the high rough three feet off the green Some golfers will use a wedge others a hooded seven iron and others still a putter depending on a number of variables the height and thickness of the rough the pitch and speed of the green and the weather among others. The point is that the best golfers have to be flexible and experienced enough to be able to hit any of these shots and others depending on any number of factors. We think the same holds true for portfolio managers and their approach to managing money. A disciplined approach Research shows that over the past 20 years broad market factors have driven about 65% of a global equity manager s relative returns with stock selection accounting for the remaining 35%. Understanding that portfolio positioning has been responsible for the majority of returns Applied Equity Advisors uses a flexible yet disciplined process powered by two engines. The first engine is the team s proprietary Factor Timing Engine designed to determine positioning with regard to broad market factors and the second being our Stock Selection Engine. In selecting stocks Applied Equity Advisors seeks to choose those companies they wish to hold in the portfolio that can achieve the desired factor positioning from a style and regional perspective. Applied Equity Advisors believes that the flexibility to intelligently position the portfolio tilting toward or away from a certain style or region depending on what the equity markets are favoring is a critical differentiator in how we approach money management. The importance of style flexibility Imagine a second shot on a long par four facing a headwind and water hazard directly in front of the green. Is it better to go for it and hit a five wood to the green or lay up with five iron The answer of course is it depends based on any number of factors but great golfers are flexible and experienced enough to hit either effectively. Similarly a good investment manager needs to be able to effectively hit on more than a single type of stock.

For illustrative purposes only and not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Source Morningstar 2015. Managers who are blindly beholden to only growth or only value will ultimately suffer when their style is out of favor. If you look over the past twenty calendar years 1999 2018 growth stocks have outperformed value stocks in nine of those years with an average outperformance of 11.26%. Similarly value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in the other eleven generating an average outperformance of 8.78% Display 2 . DISPLAY 2 Style flexibility matters The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. Clearly being constrained by a robotic adherence to either growth or value stocks forces a manager to miss out on some significant return opportunities. Yet with a more flexible approach the manager has the ability to adjust the portfolio to better capture the opportunity that the market is offering. There is no substitute for experience Every golfer knows that the more you play the tough 12th hole at the local course the better you will shoot. While our investment process is based on the premise that having the flexibility to not be constrained by style can lead to improved performance experience is a critical factor needed to make the process work. Applied Equity Advisors Factor Timing Engine is built to examine important market factors Quality Value Growth Momentum and Risk. But we believe it is the understanding of the nature of the signals including the strength valuation relative to past history and factor crowding that provides us the information necessary to make a decision much like choosing which club and strategy to use on a particularly tricky hole. Similar to comparing a seasoned professional golfer to the weekend warrior it is the combined decades of experience in interpreting these signals that sets our team and process apart from those with less experience. The 19th Hole In summary great golfers and portfolio managers need both flexibility in their approach and experience. Like our fictional gorilla the best golfers must be able to hit long straight drives off the tee. But they won t survive long on the tour if that s their only shot. They also need to be able to navigate doglegs with a combination of draws and fades and be able to hit the ball lower when playing into the wind. They need a flexible approach and only become better with practice and experience. We believe the same is true of investment managers. We believe that the best managers are the ones who are experienced and flexible enough to hit alpha given any range of broad market factors and as importantly select stocks without being constrained by a style box. We believe the end result gives investors the potential to break par. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Since the start of the year the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed has been outspoken about their shift in policy to being data dependent and patient. The market understood the former but was unclear about the latter and many economists kept one to two rate hikes in their forecasts for this year. The results of March s FOMC meeting provided needed clarity that patience means no rate hikes in 2019 and possibly one hike at an undetermined time in 2020. We believe the policy outlook for 2020 is signaling a glass half full outlook. Effectively the Fed was as dovish as they could be today without spooking the market into thinking the Fed is forecasting the end of the economic cycle. To the contrary they are trying to extend the cycle. Key FOMC Meeting Take aways Patience means no rate hikes for 4 6 quarters. Growth is downgraded. GDP projections fell to 2.1% from 2.3% for 2019 1.9% from 2.0% in 2020. Core PCE inflation forecast unchanged at 2.0%. This supports lower policy rates for longer. Balance sheet run off is expected to be stopped at the end of September. Recession probabilities likely fall because the Fed is not planning to increase rates and tighten policy to abruptly end the economic cycle. Actually it appears the Fed is trying to extend the economic cycle not end it. Our investment conclusion is that interest rates are likely to stay low and in a range which is good for carry oriented strategies and risky assets. An extension of the economic cycle along with lower interest rates makes it easier for corporations to delever. As a result credit default risks should fall thus supportive of credit products. However if the Fed s policy is successful then there is a lower limit on how far longer term yields will fall. This is because inflation expectations should increase and steepen the yield curve despite the current flattening today. This may be a second half of 2019 story. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk.

      "Doc - Orig:  Explaining Q1 Why markets regained ground from 4Q18 weakness Markets OVER estimated risks U.S. China Brexit . Thus the absence of BAD news is GOOD news. Markets UNDER appreciated global growth forming a bumpy base. We expect the second half of 2019 to be stronger. Soft data is improving China U.S. Europe lagging though some signs of hope per economic research firms like Ifo and ZEW . Hard data usually lags soft data. The improving soft data is being priced into the market now but perhaps not fully yet. Central banks became less hawkish easier as they seemingly incorporated global factors into their policy response functions especially the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed . Causality Lower rates have catalyzed the risk appetite of investors. Real yields are at very stimulative levels. U.S. 10 year real yields have collapsed to 50 basis points which has been the average following the European Central Bank s ECB s 2013 Outright Monetary Transaction OMT program. U.S. yields fell when 2019 economic growth was projected to remain above potential growth at 1.8%. The U.S. Treasury yield curve Reading the U.S. T leaves. The yield curve is telling us the Fed wants to extend the economic cycle not end it Past yield curve inversions were typically brought about by Fed policy designed to end an overheating economic cycle. This is not the case today. What s different is the Fed is adding accommodation not tightening. Lower long term yields help reduce the risk of excessive corporate leverage by allowing companies more time to de lever and refinance longer term debt at a lower yield reducing the cost of interest coverage. Q2 and Ahead Is there anything left for the market to give Yes but policy guidance needs to remain accommodative U.S. 10 year real yields of less than 80 basis points for example . A U.S. China trade deal may provide a modest boost but it seems mostly priced in already. Brexit is still a risk. Obvious exposures have been hedged but unintended consequences are a real risk. The U.S. Dollar has been sticky and it needs to weaken even marginally as a precondition for the next phase of the market rally. Global growth needs to converge i.e. rebound in the 2H19. Asset price performance Emerging markets EM are likely to benefit the most stability of global growth commodity price increases weaker dollar . We expect carry spread assets to perform well Securitized housing still strong fundamentals and technicals. Investment grade opportunities from companies de levering and moving up in credit rating. High yield still a good carry story with 6.50% yield and benefits from a low default risk environment. If central bank policy is successful economies should reflate. Sovereign bond yields would find a bottom. Inflation risk premia would rise and select developed market curves would re steepen in the 2H19. Potential Opportunities EM local debt Low inflation higher yielding reform story. We currently see opportunities in South Africa moderate inflation reprieve in credit quality ratings but it does have political risks. Mexico high yields central bank may turn dovish in line with the Fed. Also has political risk. Brazil structural reform story pensions . Also has political risk.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  In their May 1 statement the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC was upbeat on growth and downbeat on inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve Fed is now left with a conundrum on how to boost inflation but avoid creating an asset bubble. State of the Fed The risk of low inflation. The recent year over year core personal consumption expenditures PCE price index of 1.6% was lower than expected. The risk of low inflation is that it forces the Fed to keep policy rates lower than ordinary in good economic times leaving it less room to cut rates to stabilize the economy during periods of economic weakness. This is the risk concept of the Zero Lower Bound a time when it is difficult to lower nominal rates much below zero and effectively stimulate an economy. Will there be a pre emptive rate cut We believe it unlikely we ll have a pre emptive rate cut to boost inflation. The Fed sees low inflation as transitory at least for now based on other measures such as the Dallas Fed s Trimmed Mean measure of inflation which is just under 2%. Is the economy overheating The Fed does not see an overheating economy. They see asset prices as not extremely elevated leverage in the household sector under control e.g. mortgage default rates are very low and non financial sector leverage as high but funding costs remaining low. Fed cut to interest on excess reserves IOER just a technical signal. The Fed announced a cut to IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35%. This is a technical adjustment to keep the price of Fed Funds within its target range of 2.25% 2.50%. This is not meant to be a dovish policy signal. State of the Markets China stimulus is having an impact. Global growth is finding a bottom but not accelerating largely due to the China stimulus program gaining traction in 1Q19. The U.S. economy was impacted the most and first. We expect a boost for Europe and emerging markets with a 3 6 month lag and an expected resurgence in late 2Q 3Q19. A weakening U.S. dollar would signal that China stimulus is positively impacting the global economy as a whole. Until then we are likely range bound at a 2.25% 2.75% yield on the 10 year U.S. Treasury. Market Opportunities. Securitized assets. Non agency mortgage backed securities is our highest conviction sector. The consumer is strong default rates are low and home prices are steadily appreciating. Emerging markets. We expect the global economy to rebound in the 2H19 and emerging markets should benefit the most. Stable to low interest rates in developed markets and buoyant commodity prices should help emerging market assets. Even if the U.S. dollar weakens modestly as we expect this would provide incremental support to the asset class. Credit spread product. High yield is attractive as we think U.S. economic growth will remain robust and keep default rates low. We like investment grade for the same reasons. However since spreads have significantly tightened already this year carry is likely to be the biggest source of return for the remainder of the year. Market Risks There is the potential for geo political risks U.S. China Trade European Area Elections and BREXIT. We don t see any of these as being imminent though. Other risks include a disinflationary shock to the U.S. and global economy a stronger U.S. dollar and or a failure of global growth to stabilize. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks.

      "Doc - Orig:  The rates market interprets the recent breakdown in U.S. China trade negotiations and risk of tariffs with Mexico as a signal that growth and therefore inflation pressures will be slower and lower than previously expected. This is true not only in the U.S. but globally as well and the decline in U.S. yields and flattening of the yield curve are both logical price adjustments to this new information. Explaining the decline in yields We think about bond yields as a mechanism that discounts the path of short term interest rates in order to estimate the level of longer term bond yields. There are four main components to the mechanism and what follows is the current status of each Growth outlook lower declining due to trade related concerns Inflation outlook lower declining due to pressure on global growth i.e. oil and commodity prices Central bank outlook dovish Term premia falling due to all of the above i.e. investors in longer maturity bonds are demanding less risk compensation for rising inflation risks Given that all four components are pointing toward lower yields our framework leads us to conclude that rates may fall further where a 2.00% yield for the U.S. Treasury UST 10 year would not be unreasonable. However we are careful to specify this is the current status which means economic conditions could get better or worse and change the expected level of long term bond yields. What the flattening of the UST yield curve means The market broadly agrees that a flattening and especially an inversion of the yield curve is an indication of recession risk. However there is notable disagreement on the strength of this signal. As we see it the signal strength is weak. Why Because historically the yield curve has inverted when the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed was in a process of TIGHTENING i.e. intentionally raising rates too high in order to slowdown an overheating economy and contain inflation from rising well above target. We cannot emphasize enough that this is NOT the case today. The Fed has not tightened they have simply removed excess accommodation and moved to neutral. The yield curve is flattening because investors currently believe growth and inflation are less likely to accelerate in the future. Therefore the risk premia aka term premia of holding longer maturity bonds have fallen dramatically. We believe this explains why longer term yields have fallen and the yield curve subsequently flattened. We think the yield curve today represents weak signal strength for a recession but a strong signal for slower growth and inflation. To the extent that slower growth and inflation increase the probability of recession it is valid to currently attribute some coincident connection between curve flattening and recession risk with the understanding that it is not a causal relationship. Investment Strategies Growth is slowing not collapsing. This means the risk of a recession remains low thus default risks also remain low Increase allocation to higher quality duration products USTs and investment grade credit Selective opportunities in domestic real economy sectors in U.S. high yield transports home builders building materials vs. reduce exposure to trade sensitive sectors such as tech Selective emerging market exposures Central Eastern Europe countries are good candidates Non agency mortgage backed securities and select sectors in asset backed securities that are underpinned by a strong U.S. consumer RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Presidents Trump and Xi managed to beat expectations slightly at the recent G20 meeting in Osaka Japan. They met consensus in that the current trade polices between the nations remain unchanged. Positive surprises included the willingness for concessions from the U.S. with respect to Huawei and from China with respect to agriculture. Additionally Trump did not insist on a deadline for the new round of trade talks as he did at the Buenos Aires meeting in December 2018 which ultimately postponed tariffs for 3 months. Furthermore Trump s rhetoric changed with respect to China in that the U.S. should become its strategic partner and not a strategic competitor. This marks an overture to de escalate tensions emanating from the U.S. where the door is open for additional talks but without tangible details or urgency to make a trade deal. Downside risks remain a dominant theme. Global central banks to remain easy as data outlook has not improved The soft data remains very weak where consumer sentiment and global inflation as measured by PMIs continue their march toward weaker outcomes. The sharp fall in the soft data coupled with the depth of the decline is indicative of a recession within twelve months. More measurable hard data such as production output is falling but not to the degree of the sentiment driven soft data. Inflation pressures remain low and slowing corporate capital expenditure may feed upon itself and result in consumption and labor weakness. This is the risk. The bottom line The U.S. Federal Reserve Fed European Central Bank ECB and other global central banks will likely keep policy easy moving forward. Market positioning remains defensive Investors are underweight to neutral on risk. a. The U.S. Dollar is weakening as the Fed is expected to cut rates not hike. b. Global equities are in net outflow year to date. c. Conversely high quality bonds have experienced net inflows. d. Moderate to low risk exposure to emerging market and high yield is in evidence. e. As are high levels of cash. The key takeaway is that the market is better positioned to absorb volatility and less likely to force a liquidation of assets. What is the bond market telling us It depends which bond market you are talking about. The U.S. Treasuries UST market is pricing a recession in 12 months. Credit high yield is pricing an extension of the economic expansion low recession risk low default risk . The overall bond market indicates that lower UST rates are increasing the valuations of riskier assets. What is the right level for UST yields If we take at face value the market expectation for rate cuts close to 100 basis points then we believe the UST 2 year yield could fall to within a range of 1.50% 1.75%. The yield curve should have some slope if these cuts serve as insurance against rising recession risks 2s10s 25 50 basis points. This leaves the UST 10 year yield in a range of 1.75% 2.25%. We believe these levels are fair and reasonable based on what we know right now. Lower yield expectations require a more negative economic outlook than is currently priced and vice versa for higher yields. Our investment strategy Most of the investment returns attributed to long duration in our portfolios have already been recognized for this year. We believe insurance rate cuts from the Fed are mostly priced in and returns attribution in fixed income may be generated by carry and spread narrowing for the remainder of the year. Our focus remains on the real economy and the strength of the consumer in both investment grade and high yield credit. Financials building materials gaming and delevering themes in communications remain key sectors for us. Our largest exposure remains in non agency mortgages and asset backed securities due to strong credit fundamentals in select areas within this asset class.

      "Doc - Orig:  My sense is that Jerome Powell Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve is more concerned about global financial conditions namely weak global PMIs low global inflation and weakening growth everywhere than he is pacified by a strong U.S. labor market. The Fed detailed the idea of incorporating global factors into their policy reaction function in a June 2019 paper entitled Monetary Policy Financial Conditions A Cross Country Study.1 Here they introduce an augmented Taylor Rule2 that adds the notion of GDP at Risk by incorporating financial conditions alongside the already familiar inflation and full employment variables. I see this as an important development this deserves more attention than the market is currently paying towards it because it explains the Fed s policy reaction function today. The market is currently pricing a 25 basis point bps interest rate cut by the Fed in July. However I think a higher probability should be assigned to a 50 bps rate cut. The Fed s thinking may be as follows they need to cut rates by at least 50 bps this year so why wait They can cut rates by 50 bps in July and then still have the flexibility to cut another 25 bps later in the year if needed. Furthermore if the Fed is thinking along the lines of risk management they may be more inclined toward a 50 bps cut. If there is in fact evidence of a more substantial weakening of U.S. and global growth then a 25 bps cut is less effective versus a 50 bps cut as the later would give the Fed extra insurance against a declining market. The Fed could then opt not to cut further if economic activity picks up. I realize my view goes against the market consensus but in order to better understand the Fed s reaction function we need to appreciate that it is increasingly evaluating financial conditions both in the U.S. and around the globe. If you evaluate their actions through that lens then a 50 bps cut doesn t seem so unreasonable or unlikely perhaps Chairman Powell wants to keep this put option open. In conclusion Powell may not push back on a 50 bps rate cut as much as the market was thinking. DISPLAY 1 Then Now ... A Note on Emerging Markets We believe that emerging market EM fixed income may have the most upside surprise potential for the second half of 2019. The increase in asset price valuations based on an unexpected decline in interest rates may be over for 2019. Volatility may remain low as easy global central bank policy settlesinto markets. Investors may continue to reach for yield. Credit spreads may grind tighter but marginally. Global inflation to likely to remain low. EM central banks have more scope to ease as global inflation remains low and developed market central banks are not hiking rates. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the Portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  As we see it the measures of success for the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed July meeting policy decision were for the yield curve to steepen and for the U.S. dollar to weaken. The opposite happened the curve flattened and the U.S. dollar rose. This signals to us that the Fed made a policy mistake by cutting rates 25 basis points bps instead of 50. We have been strong advocates of a 50 bps rate cut despite the overwhelming market consensus for a 25 bps cut. The Fed delivered on market expectations but missed on meaningful guidance during its press conference. The market expected a 25 bps rate cut alongside dovish guidance but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did not communicate this to the market. Our rationale for a 50 bps cut was as follows The Fed is missing low on its inflation target with the core personal consumption expenditures price index PCE at 1.6% The Fed needs to steepen the yield curve A vicious cycle exists A stronger U.S. dollar pushes inflation lower and further away from the Fed s target. This is especially true if other global central banks adopt easier policies that would strengthen the U.S. dollar on a relative basis. The Fed needs to overweight the importance of reaching their inflation target. Why Because disinflation reduces long term trend consumption 70% of gross domestic product 1 Manufacturing capital expenditures and the supply side of the economy are all slumping globally too Nevertheless this event does not serve as a catalyst to materially change current portfolio positioning at the moment.

      "Doc - Orig:  The U.S. Federal Reserve Fed can lead or follow. But today we firmly believe they need to be proactive and lead and not be reactive in order to get ahead of this relative global decline in policy rates. If they follow we believe they will continue to be behind the curve and yields will likely continue to decline. Why Because the market believes the slower the Fed reacts today the more they will need to cut in the future. If the Fed leads by cutting rates proactively sooner and by more then the market will restore term premia and confidence in its future outlook for economic growth. This can potentially slow and even reverse the long term decline in yields. Success for the Fed would be reflected by a steeper yield curve and a weaker U.S. dollar USD according to the market. The USD is an important risk barometer as a stronger USD is a significant headwind to global growth and financial conditions in general. The Chinese yuan CNY fixing is a key metric to watch but as long as the USD CNY fixing continues to trend higher yields will trend lower because it shows a continuation of market stress. This fixing is also an indicator of U.S. China trade risk Other important macroeconomic factors Fiscal stimulus becoming hip and fashionable again Germany is warming to it . U.S. is headed in the same direction easier to pay for it with 50 year and 100 year bonds which has been hinted. . Globally countries are less worried about spending given how low rates are. All this talk about fiscal stimulus could stabilize markets for the time being. U.S. China trade is the key. Investment Themes We remain long duration and high on quality High yield Likes Building materials transports select retail. BB rating bias. Concerns Energy healthcare Bs CCCs. Investment grade Likes Financials utilities communications. Concerns Healthcare pharmaceuticals Risk Pace of delevering is slowing as low interest rates make refinancing more attractive. Emerging markets Opportunities Brazil reforms rate cuts Central and Eastern Europe Poland European Central Bank play central banks have room to ease Mexico cutting rates but still political risks South America high beta emerging market similar to Mexico . RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

The European Central Bank s ECB s willingness to cut rates along with an open ended quantitative easing QE program that could amount to a projected 1.4 trillion in asset purchases puts pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed to ease more aggressively in the quarters ahead. The ECB Gets Ahead of the Curve While the Fed Falls Behind The ECB s September 12 rate cut and new round of bond purchases extends Mario Draghi s reputation of doing Whatever It Takes to However Long It Takes The ECB cut rates by 10 basis points from 0.4% to a record low 0.5% The stimulus package also revives the ECB quantitative easing program buying a smaller 20 billion but committing to doing so as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates With the next rate hike not priced until six years from now if the ECB buys 20 billion per month until just prior to hiking rates then this open ended dynamic guidance would amount to approximately 1.4 trillion in asset purchases. This would be three to four times larger than any other QE program they have embarked on They also announced a tiered deposit rate to support banks so credit can reach the real economy in a cost effective manner.

      "Doc - Orig:  The economic data that are close by i.e. coming out in the next several weeks are not likely to reveal any dramatic weakness such that the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed would be compelled to cut rates. However if one extrapolates the risks for potential economic weakness due to U.S. China trade policies over the next several months and quarters defined as the near term from the Fed s perspective then cutting rates sooner to insure against anticipated future weakness may be an appropriate response. This presents a conflict between the market and the Fed where the market is counting on sooner and quicker rate cuts while the Fed may be inclined to cut later and more slowly. As such volatility may rise as asset prices reconcile the timing and degree of policy support from the Fed. Our Highest Conviction Views We believe rates will remain low U.S. consumer strength will continue and there is low recession risk and thus low default risk. Non Agency Mortgage Backed Securities MBS Credit fundamentals remain strong. a. The unemployment rate has stayed low while incomes are rising. b. Default rates and delinquencies have remained low. c. Housing is still affordable based on affordability indices. d. Housing supply remains low. Corporate Credit We have a domestic real economy bias and favor higher quality. a. Investment grade i Financials good fundamentals yield per unit of credit risk and cash flows. ii Communications mainly delevering stories. iii Basic industries metals and mining. b. High yield We like building products gaming stable and transports. We favor higher quality with a BB bias. Under the Radar Opportunities Emerging markets specifically Central Eastern Europe Czech Republic Hungary and Poland. These economies have been robust with rising inflation and seem disconnected from the risk of global slowing. These are attractive high quality bonds to own all investment grade rated because they may re connect to the global cycle if it weakens further. Biggest Risk A slowdown in China below a 6% threshold. China needs GDP growth above 6% to keep job growth stable at 13 million in 2019. Sub 6% GDP growth likely leads to a labor force contraction and the government will need to respond. A portion of the Chinese government stimulus may be consumed internally social policies to meet basic needs which means the rest of the world receives fewer external benefits from China s stimulus. This could weigh on global growth and tighten global financial conditions more than currently expected. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the Strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. Foreign securities are subject to currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Financial markets continued their good run in July with the S P 500 Index hitting a new all time high on July 26 and the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed cutting rates on July 31 for the first time in 11 years. After May s volatility on the back of bad news about U.S. China trade negotiations things seemed to be getting better. And with central bank meetings out of the way by the end of the month markets were set for a quiet August. Looked good on the surface What happened Display 1 Asset Performance Year To Date Note USD based performance. Source Thomson Reuters Datastream. Data as of July 31 2019. The indexes are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See pages 14 and 15 for index definitions. Display 2 Currency Monthly Changes Versus USD Source Bloomberg. Data as of July 31 2019. Note Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD. Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of July 31 2019 Fixed Income Outlook Unfortunately by the end of July the news flow shifted and what looked like a benign August became a lot more interesting. What gives Two things changed. The first which is easily reversible is that the Fed s cautious 25 basis point rate cut on July 31 disappointed markets which wanted more not necessarily more basis points but more commitment to additional cuts in the future. The second change is not as easily reversed. The sudden escalation of the U.S. China trade war in early August is a potentially trend altering dynamic. Further tariffs on Chinese imports and China s retaliation by buying fewer U.S. agricultural goods along with the sudden depreciation of the Chinese currency increase global economic risks significantly. For the first time since 2015 the chance of a more meaningful economic slowdown must be taken seriously. While we do not believe a true recession will occur trade developments will exacerbate an already fragile economic situation especially for manufacturing and global trade. Global business confidence has been weak for more than a year. These developments will not improve matters and will most likely hinder any rebound in economic activity anticipated for the second half of the year. What about Goldilocks Can t central banks help Central banks will try even as their monetary ammunition runs low especially outside the U.S. to keep the global economy chugging along no matter what politicians try to do. So buckle your seat belts prepare for more volatility but do not panic. We believe lower rates can and will cushion the blow coming from trade but unfortunately there are legitimate questions as to how much monetary easing can help. On the negative side lower interest rates cannot overcome the uncertainty about future economic relationships. The problem is that trade issues keep escalating and without knowing the end game how can investors be confident that they have seen the worst We think the yield curve is the best barometer of market confidence. We think a measure of success e.g. reflation would be a steepening of yield curves. If monetary stimulus is working its magic curves should steepen. Unfortunately so far this is not happening. Long maturity bonds are rallying and short maturity bonds particularly in the U.S. are well below official rates. Not a vote of confidence. Conditions are not much better or are even worse outside the U.S. Until yield curve steepening begins to happen it is unlikely economies are on sound footings and it is unlikely risky assets will perform well. This provides an environment where we should expect to see more monetary stimulus priced into markets yields fall yield curves steepen and riskier assets struggle. The ability of credit and emerging markets to absorb bad news is hurt by valuations. These markets have generated outsized returns this year and are not in a position to weather too much bad news. Whether or not there is a legitimate case for further underperformance we do not think there is a strong case to add to positions in high yield and emerging markets. Unfortunately we also do not believe we have enough information to wholesale scale back exposures. In the interim we believe a focus on fundamentals corporate sovereign and structure in the case of securitized assets will serve us best and in that regard countries that have strong and or improving fundamentals with reasonable valuations are best placed to weather this storm. On the developed sovereign side we continue to like Australia Spain and the U.S. in the emerging markets sovereign space we like Brazil and Peru on the local side and selected smaller countries somewhat insulated from global trade issues on the external side. The USD should remain generally firm except in specific instances e.g. we like the Egyptian pound which has a relatively unique set of fundamentals supporting it. Our recent mantra of nimbleness as a requirement for success remains in place. Markets and policymakers are on the move. With markets anticipating rightly or wrongly big policy moves investors are going to have to make key decisions about what tradeoffs central banks will make with regard to forestalling recession pressures by preemptive moves responding to trade risks and acting too cautiously letting recessionary forces become too strong to stop. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In July developed market sovereign bonds were mixed following the precipitous drop in yields over the preceding months. The yield on the 10 year U.S. Treasury bond rose one basis point over the month while 10 year gilt yields fell by 22 basis points and most Eurozone government bonds followed suit and declined as well. Throughout the month the markets anxiously awaited the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting on July 31st. During the weeks leading up to the meeting markets priced in a 25 basis point rate cut with certainty but also the probability of a larger 50 basis point cut. While the Fed s decision to cut by only 25 basis points did not come as a significant surprise to the market investors were disappointed that the Fed did not commit to a more significant easing bias going forward. In the Eurozone the ECB confirmed it is likely to ease policy at its meeting in September with a combination of rate cuts renewed quantitative easing QE and other easing measures likely. This largely confirmed the shift in position President Mario Draghi communicated in his speech at Sintra in early June. In the U.K. Boris Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative Party on July 23. Key roles have been given to committed supporters of Brexit whilst more than half of Theresa May s old cabinet has departed. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower for the remainder of 2019 although stabilized via easier monetary policy. Central banks have become more accommodative particularly in the U.S. and Eurozone and we expect that to continue as uncertainty in the geopolitical and economic landscape remains prevalent. We currently see three major risks to the outlook which are Brexit U.S. China trade disputes and the U.S. presidential election. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income assets continued to perform well in July as the market continued to add risk especially within dollar denominated debt. JP Morgan estimated that portfolio flows into EM fixed income totaled $9.2 billion primarily to hard currency strategies. The markets however were disappointed by the U.S. Federal Reserve s FOMC decision at the end of the month to only cut 25 basis points and were also perplexed by its convoluted statements at the accompanying press conference. The immediate impact was most evident in weaker EM currencies especially euro linked currencies in Eastern Europe which capped off a month in which the dollar strengthened and the euro weakened. Local bond performance was positive and outweighed the negative currency impact on an aggregate level. Within hard currency assets the high yield segment outperformed the investment grade segment and sovereigns outperformed corporates. Commodity prices were broadly weaker in the period led by agricultural commodities followed by crude oil prices which responded to a weaker global growth outlook and the invoicing impact of a stronger USD. Performance within metals was mixed as precious metals generally performed well while base metal prices were broadly weaker. Outlook The outlook for risky assets in the next weeks and EM debt in particular is mixed. Regarding U.S. China trade disputes hopes of an extended truce after the Shanghai summit were dashed a few days later by President Trump s announcement on a 10% tariff to be imposed on the remaining $300 billion of imports from China to take effect on Sept. 1. Moreover expected China retaliation should add to heightened volatility likely challenging the performance of risky assets. On the other hand the monetary stance being adopted across the developed and emerging worlds remains largely supportive but there could be potential setbacks as highlighted by the negative market reaction to the hawkish Fed cut last month. Credit Monthly Review July saw corporate spreads tighter overall continuing the trend in June post the move to synchronized central bank easing expectations. The key drivers in July were 1 expectations of easier monetary policy from Central Banks 2 corporate earnings exceeding weak expectations giving confidence that a downturn isn t imminent and 3 strong demand for credit. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index closed 6 basis points tighter in July to end the month at 107 basis points over government bonds.1 Financials and non financials credits performed in line. Within financials longer dated names outperformed. Euro investment grade tightened 12 basis points in July to 99 basis points as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index.2 Outlook While valuations have tightened in the strong performance of 2019 to date we would note the market recently ignored a number of signals that macro risk is rising. This includes increased risk of a hard Brexit no resolution from continued trade negotiations between the U.S. and China and weak global manufacturing data. Uncertainty makes the short term outlook for corporate earnings less clear. Our base case does not call for a recession rather we expect continued low global growth and low inflation supported by low real rates and easy financial conditions. Our strategy has been to take profits on long held positions as spreads moved below the long run average and that triggered profit taking in the month but we remain net long of risk looking to be tactical over the coming quarter. Securitized Monthly Review The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities MBS Index was up 0.40% in July outperforming the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Treasury Index which was down 0.12% as interest rates remained range bound and MBS durations were relatively unchanged.3 Current coupon agency MBS nominal spreads tightened 2 basis points in July to 85 basis points above interpolated U.S. Treasuries.4 The duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index shortened 0.08 years to 3.07 years during July a continuing trend as mortgage prepayment speeds have accelerated in recent months as the lower mortgage rates have begun to impact refinancing activity.5 The Fed s MBS portfolio shrank by $21 billion during July to $1.512 trillion and is now $125 billion lower year to date.6 Outlook Overall our outlook remains largely the same from last month. We have a positive fundamental credit outlook for residential and consumer credit conditions in both the U.S. and Europe. We continue to have a slightly negative view on agency MBS due to the supply demand dynamics from the Fed continuing to reduce its MBS holdings and increasing market float by approximately $20 billion each month but we have become less negative on agency MBS in 2019 as it has underperformed credit mortgage assets this year. We continue to have a mixed outlook on commercial real estate conditions due the more idiosyncratic nature of specific real estate sectors and properties. 1 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of July 31 2019 2 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of July 31 2019 3 Source Bloomberg data as of July 31 2019 4 Source JP Morgan as of July 31 2019 5 Source Bloomberg as of July 31 2019 6 Source Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of July 31 2019 RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  With the world economy emerging from a growth scare in the fourth quarter of 2018 we were confident that the U.S. and global economies were steadily recovering and not headed towards a recession. Our expectation was that the recovery may take a few more quarters to take hold based on a combination of cyclical and structural trends. That all changed on the 10 May when an increase in tariffs on Chinese imports announced by President Trump took effect reviving the game of tariffs between China and the U.S. that has been a drag on the global economy. This did not come as a surprise to us as the U.S. China trade tension is one of the key binary risks we highlighted in our previous outlook. Despite the tensions we believe the medium term growth story remains intact but given recent heightening of trade tensions this may be delayed. In fact these trade tensions may increase the likelihood of further fiscal stimulus in China and the U.S. although this may be accompanied by volatility. Treading carefully around potential near term volatility investors should be keeping an eye on the midgame. We are navigating this near term disruption by reducing risk in our portfolios on a short term basis with the aim of eventually moving back into equities. Despite tensions global trade might have found a floor The China U.S. trade tensions have hindered world trade resulting in the most significant decline in volumes since the 2008 crisis Display 1 and impacting export reliant economies. World trade flows pulled back in February 2019 following a January improvement in a move that was telegraphed by Q1 softness in new export order PMI Purchasing Managers Index data. Display 1 Trade flows damaged by tariffs Source CPB Bloomberg. Data as at 10 May 2019. Prior to recent tensions new export data had indicated a significant rebound in Chinese orders and a potential bottom for orders in Europe Display 2 . The trade battles of early May have the potential to again destabilise this in the short run but we still expect trade flows to improve in the medium term. China is important to the recovery A central piece to the turnaround has been the stimulus in China. While the current stimulus is only about 1.5% of GDP on the fiscal side a steep drop from nearly 10% in 2008 it is far more targeted.1 The last three Chinese stimulus cycles drove money into the property markets which is a quick way to boost consumption. Cities like Beijing Shanghai and Shenzhen experienced property price increases as high as 30 40% per annum2. This created a bubble as people sought to direct more funds into the easy money property markets. Display 2 China s new export orders rebound and the eurozone may have found a floor Source Nikkei Markit Datastream. Data as at 10 May 2019. Today s stimulus has been devised to prevent the bubble from bursting It includes policies aimed at maintaining the relative tightening on the property side while directing the fiscal stimulus to the private sector and the consumer. Given the nature of the new stimulus we expect it to operate more slowly than in the past but ultimately be more sustainable. The Chinese consumer is far more indebted today than in the past. Over the last 10 years debt levels have nearly doubled Display 3 . Although still manageable compared to other countries debts the speed with which this level has risen is a concern. Also concerning is the younger generation s struggle to save The cost of living is rising and mortgage rates are running at about 5% to 6% compared to 2% in the UK. It will not be easy for consumers to go on a spending spree. While aware of the longer term risks of growing household debt Chinese policymakers do not want their economy to slow any further. With tariff tensions rising again they have already made some tentative moves to further increase the stimulus but they seem to be keeping further increases in property prices as a last resort. Display 3 Owing more Chinese consumer debt is rising Source Bloomberg National Bureau of Statistics of China. Data as at 10 May 2019. The value of U.S. public infrastructure. . . Both the President and Congressional Democrats have supported fiscal stimulus through infrastructure programmes with a $2 trillion target discussed last November. Nevertheless during a recent meeting with the Democratic leadership Trump made his support for infrastructure contingent on Congressional investigations into his administration and business stopping. While this is a setback it appears that backchannels for progress on legislative initiatives still remain open for example the disaster aid bill just passed by the Senate and is still supported by Trump . We still believe that an infrastructure spending programme remains highly popular with the public and would be likely to prevent a recession in 2020. These politically powerful drivers suggest that this initiative may be reconsidered soon. Senate Republican support would be contingent on how this initiative was funded and a gasoline tax which has not been increased since the Clinton administration remains a good possibility even though in the end a major infrastructure bill is likely to be front loaded and paid for initially with debt. . . . and the case for an uptick in private investment Business fixed investment is typically the most cyclical element in GDP with a disproportionate impact on the business cycle. Display 4 tracks how core CapEx growth recovered from the lows of 2015 and 2016 peaked in December 2017 and then stabilised somewhat before plunging in 2018. This sharp drop was likely in large part due to the trade war. Uncertainties about global supply chains forced businesses to postpone needed investment. The slight March 2019 rebound represents the biggest improvement in corporate investment in eight months. Display 4 U.S. business equipment orders are stable to improving Source U.S. Census Bureau Bloomberg. Data as at 10 May 2019. The recent revival in tensions certainly has the potential to postpone CapEx again but there are several trends constructive for business fixed investment to grow in the medium term. Most importantly there is a significant pent up demand with existing capital equipment very obsolete and technological change moving at a rapid pace businesses desperately need to upgrade their capital stock. Meanwhile climate change related disruptions will tend to accelerate the rate of capital investment as the economy transitions towards things like electric vehicles and solar energy. And any fiscal stimulus programme based on infrastructure spending would also boost capital expenditures CapEx . Stimulus prospects in Europe As populist movements continue to gather support as demonstrated in the recent EU Parliamentary elections the pressure on European governments to increase spending grows. A stimulus agenda appears to be gaining with it. The Eurozone s four largest economies now appearing likely to implement expansionary fiscal measures in 2019. This expectation is supported by the latest data from the European Commission which anticipate some degree of stimulus from Germany France Italy and Spain Display 5 . Display 5 For Eurozone s four largest economies stimulus looks likely Source European Commission MSIM. Data from European Economic Forecast Spring 2019 released on 7 May 2019. Forecasts estimates are based on current market conditions subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass. The outlook for automobiles The traditional bounce in auto production may not be as pronounced as during previous cycles. In fact the disruptive transition from internal combustion engine to electrical vehicles may weaken the effect of industry growth in the short term. Many auto manufacturers are planning to shift to electric vehicles a change that could be quite constructive for longer term capital investment. Employment though could suffer because the production of electric vehicles requires far less labour. Automakers may close down facilities before they open new ones so to the extent this occurs it could take time to see the potential boost to net investment. We expect a recovery but not in the traditional V shape While stimulus from China helped create a V shaped recovery in 2015 2016 their current stimulus is both smaller and designed to benefit just China with less constructive spillover to the rest of the world. Global inventories are also generally too high likely due to stockpiling in anticipation of Brexit disruptions and the trade war Display 6 . This excessive inventory cycle will have to be worked off. For example the semiconductor downturn has not bottomed with high chip inventory levels still weakening spending. Display 6 UK manufacturing inventories show evidence of stockpiling Source Markit CIPS Bloomberg. Data as at 10 May 2019. Nevertheless what is usually missing from a sustainable recovery is growth in CapEx. Today we see strong potential for CapEx growth though it may be postponed by trade tensions. Moreover we see several self reinforcing countercyclical elements that may help even in the face of the trade war. The more intense the tariff tensions become the more likely it becomes that the Chinese will increase their stimulus and the U.S. will pass a significant infrastructure plan. And companies are more prepared now for shifted supply chains than they were when the trade war was initiated. Ignore mostly the trade noise The medium term outlook is positive. While trade issues do suggest near term caution fiscal stimulus in China potential U.S. infrastructure spending and the pent up demand for capital expenditure are all powerful positives that are ready to help the markets as soon as the trade dispute is resolved. A resolution would also help with European fixed investment which is closely tied to trade. Eurozone equity valuations look attractive based on the average yield premium versus bonds Display 7 . Also the European Central Bank ECB is turning much friendlier towards the banking system than it was in the past. We also expect more consolidation in European banks. One area where we are cautious is the U.S. technology sector where valuations again appear to be overshooting earnings. On bonds our longer term outlook is positive for the economy so negative for bonds. But tariff tensions can make bonds on a temporary basis look more attractive.

The growth story remains intact As highlighted in one of our recent commentaries the revival of U.S. China trade tensions is one of the binary risks that could complicate our generally positive view on a global recovery. And while these unpredictable lightning strikes emanating from the White House have a disruptive near term impact we nonetheless remain positive on the medium term growth story the midgame. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Although many investors have become more tentative they could be overlooking two big factors for 2020 improving earnings and a possible election year surge for the economy. At first glance U.S. equities seem to be riding a bullish wave. The S P 500 is up more than 20% in 2019 and the steady stream of IPOs for high profile unicorns throughout the year suggested there was still appetite for growth story stocks. In actuality stocks are sitting under a pall of pessimism with the market little higher than it was in September 2018. What upside we ve seen has been fueled by corporations buying back their own stock and investors bidding up so called safety stocks. The consensus outlook estimates 11% earnings growth next year vs. flat growth for this year suggesting that the market has room to run. Andrew Slimmon Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team Investment Management Individual investors for their part largely haven t benefited. Between early December 2018 and mid August 2019 equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds saw $230 billion in net redemptions. As a percentage of total assets the 52 week outflow is the most we ve seen since the bottom of the market in 2002. Meanwhile investors have poured more than $476 billion into money market funds so far this year.1 This is a classic case of recency bias where investors decisions are based on what s behind them rather than what s ahead. Although this bearish sentiment has taken hold for many investors and has even been the topic of some debate here at Morgan Stanley my team and I believe that this outlook misses some significant positive factors for 2020 potential for improving earnings against relatively weak year over year comparisons and an incumbent president intent on boosting the economy as election day 2020 approaches. Here are some key points for investors to keep top of mind as we hit the final stretch of 2019 and into year ahead. The Power of an Election Year Historically the re election of an incumbent U.S. president hinges largely on the economy. Over the past century an incumbent was re elected in all cases where there wasn t a recession in the previous two years in only one case Calvin Coolidge did an incumbent win despite a recession. The Presidential cycle has historically had an impact on markets No recession 2 years before election vs. recession 2 years before election Recession President Year Reelection NO Obama 2012 YES NO Bush 43 2004 YES NO Clinton 1996 YES NO Reagan 1984 YES NO Nixon 1972 YES NO Johnson 1964 YES NO Eisenhower 1956 YES NO Truman 1948 YES NO FDR 1944 YES NO FDR 1940 YES NO FDR 1936 YES NO Wilson 1916 YES YES Bush 41 1992 NO YES Carter 1980 NO YES Ford 1976 NO YES Hoover 1932 NO YES Coolidge 1924 YES YES Taft 1912 NO Source Wall Street Journal Daily Shot May 23 2019. Yet voters have short term memories. The key isn t how the economy performs during this quarter but how it s faring this time next year. The current administration knows this which could be why the administration is proceeding deliberately with China trade negotiations. A lack of resolution on trade near term could also compel the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates. A China trade deal alongside lower interest rates and the promise of an infrastructure bill could mean an economic shot in the arm for the U.S. in 2020. The upshot Our opinion is that President Trump will want the economy to be running hot heading into the polls next year. While that reduces the odds of an economic recession in 2020 it increases the risk of a pullback in 2021. Earnings Are Set to Reaccelerate As we ve noted throughout this year corporate earnings growth will likely be flat or contract in 2019 not because they are abysmal but because of the comparison with exceptional growth in 2018. The market has known this which is why stocks flirted with bear market territory late last year. Remember the market is a forward predictor. It rewards future positive rates of change and penalizes negative rates of change. As of early September the consensus outlook estimates 11% earnings growth next year vs. flat growth for this year suggesting that the market has room to run. I should note that my colleagues in the firm s Global Investment Committee have nuanced views on how an earnings recession could spiral into an economic recession in 2020 but in my view an earnings recession doesn t always mean an economic recession. Again this has been particularly true during an election year with an incumbent president. The upshot Relatively flat earnings growth in 2019 essentially lowers the bar for better comparables in 2020. .amcharts chart div a display none important We believe a 2019 earnings recession is a possibility followed by a reacceleration in earnings Quarter over quarter Real U.S. Earnings Growth Q1 2014 Present Source Bloomberg as of August 22 2019 Sideways Markets Don t Last Forever As mentioned earlier the market has effectively moved sideways since this time last year. What s more this isn t against a backdrop of investor exuberance. On the contrary investors have yanked money out of equity funds and are hoarding cash. By many measures bearish sentiment is the highest it s been since the height of the financial crisis. Historically this story doesn t end with a market crash but a rally. On seven occasions since 1900 the market has been flat for 350 or more trading days and in all cases the market was up six months later. The upshot Markets need to boom before they bust. The longer a market trades sideways the higher the likelihood that it breaks to the upside. .amcharts chart div a display none important After extended periods of consolidation the market has historically broken to the upside S P 500 March 9 2009 August 22 2019 Source FactSet Investors Should Take a Measured Approach Several factors suggest that the market will be higher a year from now than it is today but we aren t prescribing that investors wait for a pullback and jump back in feet first. As is the case in virtually every market environment we believe dollar cost averaging may make a great deal of sense today. Stylistically growth stocks still look expensive relative to value but they are not as expensive as they were at the peak in 2000. In fact if there is any bubble today it s in defensive stocks such as utilities and consumer staples. Investors are paying very high multiples for relative safety and nothing for cyclicality. The upshot Investors may want to avoid extremes both in terms of timing and allocation. Adapted from the recent webcast 2019 Equity Market Update Isn t the Equity Market a Forward Predictor Risk Considerations Dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss in declining markets. For the strategy to be effective you must continue to purchase shares both in market ups and market downs. In addition if the market gains you may miss out on the potential gains. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the Portfolio will decline and may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this Portfolio. Please be aware that this Portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Footnotes 1 Source Investment Company Institute \n",

lack of resolution on trade near term could also compel the federal reserve to continue cut interest rate . a china trade deal alongside low interest rate and the promise of an infrastructure bill could mean an economic shot in the arm for the u.s. in 2020 . the upshot opinion be that president trump will want the economy to be run hot heading into the poll next year . while that reduce the odd

      "Doc - Orig:  Another tumultuous month saw major developed market rates rally with the U.S. Treasury yields dropping 16 basis points bps with the yield curve flattening further. Emerging market EM performance was mixed with local currency debt generating positive returns while hard currency debt ended in negative territory. But alas as the weather has continued to cool so too have the markets. Global credit underperformed government bonds as spreads including both high yield and investment grade widened in November both macroeconomic sentiment changes and concerns about microeconomic fundamentals contributed. e.g. the 20 percent drop in Brent crude did not help the energy sector. European corporate bond performance was notable as it continued its penchant to underperform U.S. credit. Securitized credit spreads also widened in sympathy with corporate bonds although there were less obvious catalysts. DISPLAY 1 Asset Performance Year to Date Note USD based performance.

Note Positive change means appreciation of the currency against the USD. DISPLAY 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of November 30 2018. Fixed Income Outlook As we enter 2019 two specific challenges face the two largest economies in the world. First will U.S. financial markets have a soft bumpy or hard landing following the likely peak of growth and earnings that were reached in 2018 Second will stimulus policies in China stabilize growth conditions Resolutions for both will be the key drivers for U.S. economy s financial asset prices in the months ahead. U.S. fiscal policy was the major story this year. It energized the U.S. economy just as the rest of the world began to slow down. This divergence has been the major driver of asset markets. Loose fiscal policy stronger than expected growth and higher than expected rates propelled the dollar higher again higher than the market anticipated. The adrenaline shot the U.S. economy received in 2018 should weaken significantly in 2019 slowing the economy reducing inflation risk and reducing the probability of ever higher short term rates. While a slower economy is good for risk free rates and reduced inflationary pressures the impact on credit and earnings is more ambivalent. It will depend on how much the economy slows how weak the equity market gets and how high inflation goes. Context is important. We believe that tax reform and deregulation spurred business investment and a capital deepening that catalyzed a reversal in the falling trend in productivity. The rise in productivity may have a longer lasting impact that may lead to higher potential growth. The initial impulse was recorded in 2018 with U.S. gross domestic product GDP growing at 3 percent versus original consensus estimates of around 2 percent which proved too low. Consensus expectation is for growth to slow to 2.6 percent in 2019 and to slow further to 1.8 percent in 2020 a level we think is about equal to potential growth. Our base case is that the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed will engineer a soft landing by not hiking too much likely ending the rate hiking cycle at 3 percent in June 2019. Credit asset performance will be impacted by post peak dynamics in growth and earnings. It needs to be recognized that this asset class is more vulnerable than usual at this point in an economic cycle due to high levels of leverage in the post quantitative easing QE era. That said interest coverage is very strong at an aggregate level and should pose no systemic risk to the economy. Although a recession is not our base case scenario in the next couple of years risk premia has risen and will likely rise further adjusting spreads wider to reflect the increased weighting of this risk. But this also assumes static behavior in the corporate sector. We should not assume solidly performing companies will do nothing if credit conditions deteriorate further. How soon how deep how long a slowdown might materialize are therefore questions that need to be reconciled. We believe a soft landing scenario will benefit credit assets as we move along in 2019. As previously mentioned the outlook for the Chinese economy could be crucial for the performance of the global economy in 2019. Weakness in China this year has been due in no small measure to the significant policy tightening in 2017 early 2018. In 2017 China increased short rates by over 200 bps pushing the renminbi up by 7 percent as Chinese policymakers attempted to slowly deleverage the economy. But the unanticipated escalation of U.S. trade tensions in conjunction with previous tightening moves has resulted in a significant reduction in the Chinese contribution to global growth which was certainly felt in Europe. In response to this unwanted slowdown with the risk of more due to ongoing trade tensions China has engaged in aggressive easing such as lowering short term rates by more than 200bps in 2018 and cutting the required reserve ratio RRR by 250bps. The good news is that there are signs of the stimulus working. Since easing policies tend to work with a lag we hopefully will see further stabilization of the economy as we move into 2019 offsetting negative effects of U.S. tariffs. Chinese economic and asset price stability will be supportive of global asset prices especially but not only confined to EM. In conclusion we see market uncertainty revolving around whether or not the end of the Fed tightening cycle will produce a soft bumpy or hard landing and whether or not China s stimulus policies enacted in 2018 and likely continuing into 2019 will stabilize their economy in 2019. Additional considerations reside with Europe and Brexit political risks that are difficult to price. Risk premia are on the rise pushing asset prices below fundamental valuations in a non uniform manner making investment opportunities more idiosyncratic than systematic. We remain optimistic that absent any signs of economic deterioration a soft landing supportive of asset prices is the most likely scenario for 2019. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In November we saw DM yields moving lower where U.S. 10 year Treasury and German Bunds fell 16 bps and 7 bps respectively. U.K. rates also experienced big moves where 10 year gilt yields fell 7bps but 30 year bond yields rose 22 bps amidst new Brexit developments. Italian bonds yields rallied 13 22 bps across the curve while Portugal fell 2 8 bps. The U.S. yield curve flattened further with the U.S. Treasury 2s10s spread tightening 7bps this month to 20 bps.1 Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower in 2019 as the fiscal impulse wears off and the lagged effect of higher rates bite. Recent speeches from the Fed policymakers give us further confidence that they are cognizant of the risk of over tightening and the need to move at some point in the near future to a more data dependent policy. The Fed wants to contain inflation risk it does not want to cause a hard landing recession. It is therefore likely that the market may also acknowledge that the peak in U.S. Treasury 10 year yield is likely to be below 3.50 percent. A longer term risk is a wider band for Japan Government Bonds JGB yields as the Bank of Japan BoJ adjusts the yield curve control policy. This could introduce more volatility and create an upward push for risk free rates. But for now the BoJ does not appear to be in a rush. Ultimately we see market uncertainty revolving around whether or not the end of the Fed tightening cycle will produce a soft bumpy or hard landing and whether or not China s stimulus policies enacted in 2018 and likely continuing into 2019 will stabilize their economy in 2019. Additional considerations reside with Europe and Brexit political risks that are difficult to value. Risk premia are on the rise pushing asset prices below fundamental valuations in a non uniform manner making investment opportunities more idiosyncratic than systematic. We remain optimistic that absent any signs of economic deterioration a soft landing supportive of asset prices is the most likely scenario for 2019. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income asset performance was mixed in the month with local currency debt posting positive returns while hard currency debt returns ended in negative territory. While not calling for a recession in the near future global growth estimates have been reduced as data has underperformed optimism. The outlook for global growth has been overshadowed by the risks arising from trade disputes initiated by the U.S. and the implications for global trade. Despite an improved outlook for North American trade via the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement s NAFTA s replacement United States Mexico Canada Agreement USMCA there remains an ongoing dispute between the U.S. and China. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation APEC summit ended in disarray after the U.S. and China failed to agree on a joint statement reflecting tensions due to the ongoing trade war. This is the first time since the summit began in 1993 that no joint statement was issued. Political risk in Europe increased during the period as Russia seized three naval vessels from Ukraine prompting the imposition of martial law in Ukraine. Outlook After a challenging year for EM fixed income we hold a constructive outlook for 2019 driven by attractive valuations a benign global backdrop of moderate growth subdued inflation and a Fed that is likely approaching the end of its tightening cycle. We believe these factors and growing twin deficits in the U.S. limit the scope for material U.S. Dollar USD appreciation. Our historical analysis indicates that EM fixed income tends to outperform when EM economies are closing negative output gaps and converging toward potential growth. Credit Monthly Review Global investment grade spreads widened in November firmly establishing new year to date wides. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index widened by 19 bps in November to end the month at 137 bps over government bonds with financials leading the market wider. Spreads in the U.S. are now wider than they have been since the 3rd quarter of 2016. For the year U.S. investment grade corporates are 44 bps wider on average. In Europe the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index moved 21 bps wider to end the month at 149 bps relative to governments. European corporate bonds continue to underperform U.S. investment grade as European investment grade corporates are 63 bps wider for the year.2 One would have to look back to the energy crisis in early 2016 to find similarly wide spreads in the European investment grade market. As in prior months the drivers of credit remain macroeconomic worries and concerns about company fundamentals especially leverage in BBB credit . Compounding these worries are poor technicals headed into year end the most notable symptom being limited risk appetite in the dealer community. Outlook Looking forward to 2019 the dangers cited are known credible and well debated and arguably in the price . The opportunity is that the recession does not arrive again and global growth stabilizes. In this scenario the increased systemic risk premium is unjustified as default rates stay low company earnings continue to grow higher yields stimulate demand for fixed income credit and confidence in the market increases liquidity. Securitized Monthly Review Widening securitized credit spreads and rallying risk free interest rates were the primary market themes in November. Securitized credit spreads had been resilient to spread widening for most of 2018 as spreads in corporate sectors and EM drifted wider. However securitized credit spreads could not with stand the pressures coming from other sectors and have now widened for two consecutive months. Fundamental securitized credit conditions remain sound with low default rates healthy consumer balance sheets and stable housing markets but increasing volatility greater concerns over the future health of the U.S. economy widening spreads in other credit sectors are combining to put pressure on securitized credit spreads. Agency mortgage backed securities MBS outperformed credit sensitive securitized for the first time this year as their agency MBS spreads were essentially unchanged. Outlook We are becoming a little more cautious on securitized credit assets. While we believe the fundamental credit environment remains positive volatility has increased and credit spreads have now widened for two straight months. We do not anticipate any near term deterioration of credit performance in the form of increased delinquencies or defaults but we believe that credit spreads could continue to widen as the market s appetite for risk appears to be weakening. 1 Source Bloomberg.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

landing by not hike too much likely end the rate hiking cycle at 3 percent in june 2019 . credit asset performance will be impact by post peak dynamic in growth and earning . need to be recognize that this asset class be more vulnerable than usual at this point in an economic cycle due to high level of leverage in the post quantitative ease qe era . that say interest coverage be very strong at an aggregate level and should pose no systemic risk to the economy . although a recession be not base case scenario in the next couple of year risk premia have rise and will likely rise further adjust spread wide to reflect the increase weighting of this risk . but this also assume static behavior in the corporate sector . should not assume solidly perform company will do nothing if credit condition deteriorate further . how soon how deep how long a slowdown might materialize be therefore question that need to be reconcile . believe a soft landing scenario will benefit credit asset as move along in 2019 . as previously mention the outlook for the chinese economy could be crucial for the performance of the global economy in 2019 . weakness in china this year have be due in no small measure to the significant policy tightening in 2017 early 2018 . in 2017 china increase short rate by over 200 bps push the renminbi up by 7 percent as chinese policymaker attempt to slowly deleverage the economy . but the unanticipated escalation of u.s. trade tension in conjunction with previous tightening move have result in a significant reduction in the chinese contribution to global growth which be certainly feel in europe . in response to this unwanted slowdown with the risk of more due to ongoing trade tension china have engage in aggressive easing such as lower short term rate by more than 200bps in 2018 and cut the require reserve ratio rrr by 250bps . the good news be that there be sign of the stimulus work . since ease policy tend to work with a lag hopefully will see further stabilization of the economy as move into 2019 offset negative effect of u.s. tariff . chinese economic and asset price stability will be supportive of global asset price especially but not only confine to em . in conclusion see market uncertainty revolve around whether or not the end of the fed tighten cycle will produce a soft bumpy or hard landing and whether or not china s stimulus policy enact in 2018 and likely continue into 2019 will stabilize economy in 2019 . additional consideration reside with europe and brexit political risk that be difficult to price . risk premia be on the rise push asset price below fundamental valuation in a non uniform manner make investment opportunity more idiosyncratic than systematic . remain optimistic that absent any sign of economic deterioration a soft landing supportive of asset price be the most likely scenario for 2019 . develop market dm rate foreign currency fx monthly review in november see dm yield move low where u.s. 10 year treasury and german bunds fall 16 bps and 7 bps respectively . u.k. rate also experience big move where 10 year gilt yield fall 7bps but 30 year bond yield rise 22 bps amidst new brexit development . italian bond yield rally 13 22 bps across the curve while portugal fall 2 8 bps . the u.s. yield curve flatten further with the u.s. treasury 2s10s spread tighten 7bps this month to 20 bps.1 outlook u.s. growth be likely to be low in 2019 as the fiscal impulse wear off and the lag effect of high rate bite . recent speech from the fed policymaker give further confidence that be cognizant of the risk of over tightening and the need to move at some point in the near future to a more data dependent policy . the fed want to contain inflation risk do not want to cause a hard landing recession . be therefore likely that the market may also acknowledge that the peak in u.s. treasury 10 year yield be likely to be below 3.50 percent . a long term risk be a wide band for japan government bonds jgb yield as the bank of japan boj adjust the yield curve control policy . this could introduce more volatility and create an upward push for risk free rate . but for now the boj do not appear to be in a rush . ultimately see market uncertainty revolve around whether or not the end of the fed tighten cycle will produce a soft bumpy or hard landing and whether or not china s stimulus policy enact in 2018 and likely continue into 2019 will stabilize economy in 2019 . additional consideration reside with europe and brexit political risk that be difficult to value . risk premia be on the rise push asset price below fundamental valuation in a non uniform manner make investment opportunity more idiosyncratic than systematic . remain optimistic that absent any sign of economic deterioration a soft landing supportive of asset price be the most likely scenario for 2019 . emerge market em rate fx monthly review em fix income asset performance be mix in the month with local currency debt post positive return while hard currency debt return end in negative territory . while not call for a recession in the near future global growth estimate have be reduce as datum have underperformed optimism . the outlook for global growth have be overshadow by the risk arise from trade dispute initiate by the u.s. and the implication for global trade . despite an improved outlook for north american trade via the signing of the north american free trade agreement s nafta s replacement united states mexico canada agreement usmca there remain an ongoing dispute between the u.s. and china . the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit end in disarray after the u.s. and china fail to agree on a joint statement reflect tension due to the ongoing trade war . this be the first time since the summit begin in 1993 that no joint statement be issue . political risk in europe increase during the period as russia seize three naval vessel from ukraine prompt the imposition of martial law in ukraine . outlook after a challenging year for em fix income hold a constructive outlook for 2019 drive by attractive valuation a benign global backdrop of moderate growth subdue inflation and a fed that be likely approach the end of tightening cycle . believe these factor and grow twin deficit in the u.s. limit the scope for material u.s. dollar usd appreciation . historical analysis indicate that em fix income tend to outperform when em economy be close negative output gap and converge toward potential growth . credit monthly review global investment grade spread widen in november firmly establish new year to date wide . the bloomberg barclays u.s. corporate index widen by 19 bps in november to end the month at 137 bps over government bond with financial lead the market wider . spread in the u.s. be now wide than have be since the 3rd quarter of 2016 . for the year u.s. investment grade corporate be 44 bp wide on average . in europe the bloomberg barclays euro aggregate corporate index move 21 bps wide to end the month at 149 bps relative to government . european corporate bond continue to underperform u.s. investment grade as european investment grade corporate be 63 bp wide for the year.2 one would have to look back to the energy crisis in early 2016 to find similarly wide spread in the european investment grade market . as in prior month the driver of credit remain macroeconomic worry and concern about company fundamental especially leverage in bbb credit . compound these worry be poor technical head into year end the most notable symptom be limit risk appetite in the dealer community . outlook look forward to 2019 the danger cite be know credible and well debate and arguably in the price . the opportunity be that the recession do not arrive again and global growth stabilize . in this scenario the increase systemic risk premium be unjustified as default rate stay low company earning continue to grow high yield stimulate demand for fixed income credit and confidence in the market increase liquidity . securitized monthly review widen securitized credit spread and rally risk free interest rate be the primary market theme in november . securitized credit spread have be resilient to spread widen for most of 2018 as spread in corporate sector and em drift wider . however securitized credit spread could not with stand the pressure come from other sector and have now widen for two consecutive month . fundamental securitized credit condition remain sound with low default rate healthy consumer balance sheet and stable housing market but increase volatility great concern over the future health of the u.s. economy widen spread in other credit sector be combine to put pressure on securitized credit spread . agency mortgage back security mbs outperform credit sensitive securitize for the first time this year as agency mbs spread be essentially unchanged . outlook be become a little more cautious on securitized credit asset . while believe the fundamental credit environment remain positive volatility have increase and credit spread have now widen for two straight month . do not anticipate any near term deterioration of credit performance in the form of increase delinquency or default but believe that credit spread could continue to widen as the market s appetite for risk appear to be weaken . 1 source bloomberg . datum as of november 30 2018 . 2 source bloomberg barclays . datum as of november 30 2018 . risk considerations fix income security be subject to the ability

      "Doc - Orig:  MSCI added China A shares into many of the key global indices for the first time which will undoubtedly boost foreign interest in this under owned and under researched equity investment class. With more than 3 300 listed companies and a total market cap of around $7.8 trillion the China A shares market represents a vast untapped opportunity.1 It s hard to imagine a bigger market with this much potential anywhere. The A shares market is large and liquid but highly inefficient in our view and therein lies both the dangers and the opportunities. It may be the only large stock market in the world in which individual investors account for the vast majority we estimate about 80 percent of daily trading volume.2 In more established markets retail investors are less influential on the market movement. The result is big swings in stock prices and unusually high dispersion in valuations. Because this kind of investment pattern tends to be more short term oriented and driven by newsflow they can derail passive buy and hold strategies and create opportunities for active managers. Moreover in the A shares market even most of the institutional investors act more like retail investors by trading constantly. A market this immature and diverse also offers frequent opportunities to buy or sell stocks that are overlooked or misunderstood. We have seen numerous instances in which local A shares investors could not or did not do simple homework failing to meet with a company and understand the earnings implications of an overseas acquisition or new expansions or failing to meet with new management. This opportunity does not exist to the same degree for companies in the MSCI China Index which are typically larger more transparent and more closely covered by analysts. Within our focus on the new China we are tracking a few key themes built around companies that are deploying a new generation of skilled workers and companies that are catering to them as consumers. As cheap skilled labor displaces cheap labor in the Chinese economy incomes are rising in sectors from industrials to consumer companies and demand is rising in sectors such as tourism luxury goods toys and games and beauty care. All these sectors are well represented in the A share market. And since Chinese consumers still spend much less on average than their counterparts in the rest of the G20 there is still plenty of room for the consumer sectors to grow.3 That adds to the excitement and appeal of the A shares market. We remain focused on looking for the best investment ideas and for companies that will benefit from the multi year structural story that is China. While the market over the longer term will become more efficient we believe ample opportunities exist for active managers to capture extra idiosyncratic alpha return from the market. 1 Shanghai Stock Exchange website as of June 21 2019. 2 MSIM as of June 2019. 3 World Bank Euromonitor Citi as of May 2018. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk . Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  The auto industry is critically important for the global economy but it has seen a disruptive slide global registrations demand and production have slumped. The decline in passenger car demand seems to be persistent and independent of trade tariffs. Rather it seems to be driven primarily by tighter emissions standards and government initiatives aimed at encouraging a shift towards electric vehicles EVs . The economic implications are likely to follow a U shaped pattern with a destructive decline followed by investment driven growth. Autos Critical to manufacturing and employment Any slowdown in the industry is likely to have significant global economic ramifications. Automobiles are a key part of the manufacturing sector in a number of countries Display 1 . In 2017 the global industry directly employed roughly eight million people and indirect employment think automobile components is estimated to be between 4.3x U.S. and 6.2x Japan that of direct employment.1 And indirect employment does not take into account second order effects such as the positive influence on towns built around car factories. DISPLAY 1 A global industry Source OICA Datastream data as of 31 December 2018 On the skids Global car demand China which makes up almost 30% of global passenger car demand saw vehicle registrations contract by over 4% year over year YoY in 2018 the first decline since the 1990s.2 Through June 2019 registrations fell further and were down 12.9% YoY Display 2 . This is meaningful none of the growth shocks China has faced over the past decade resulted in a contraction in sales. A combination of cyclical and structural factors likely contributed to the growth deceleration and we do not expect a pronounced rebound in sales over the next 6 12 months. Given the weakening Chinese economic growth elevated uncertainty and softening employment growth it is not surprising that fewer consumers are purchasing a new car. The EU which employs nearly 14 million people in the auto sector 1 felt a similar drop. After China the EU is the second largest auto manufacturer within which Germany is the largest producer and most exposed. DISPLAY 2 Caution steep descent in demand Source Bloomberg data as of 30 July 2019 Global passenger car production has mirrored the drop in registrations falling 3.2% in 2018 the first contraction since the financial crisis of 2008 .3 This is especially striking in China and Germany where production is down 15% YoY in both economies Display 3 . Both domestic demand and exports are suffering and the trend does not appear to be linked to a recession or the trade war. In China for example 90% of automobile production is domestic.4 DISPLAY 3 Car production is also falling Source Verband der Automobilindustrie Japan Auto Dealers Manufacturers Association Haver Analytics CAAM In some countries particularly the U.S. and to a lesser extent China and India this trend can be partially explained by a bigger is better preference for SUVs and light trucks which are not included in global car data. When looking at all vehicles including SUVs and light trucks the data is not quite as stark but it clearly reflects an overall deceleration in the vehicle market. Notably the decline in sales does not apply to battery electric vehicles which have been growing albeit from a very low base. Japan has been able to dodge the trend towards declining production Display 3 as they have been one of the countries most focused on hybrids and energy efficient vehicles. Applying the brakes Global emissions standards Much of this global decline seems to be driven by increasingly strict governmental policies regulating the internal combustion engine ICE . In fact various regions have tightened emissions standards where they essentially mandate the sale of electric vehicles. Manufacturers are at a point where it is no longer possible to further improve mileage efficiencies or reduce vehicle weights. Therefore the only solution is to pivot to EVs. The EU for example has set targets to cut passenger car CO2 emissions from 130g km to 95g km by 2030. If an auto manufacturer s fleet has average CO2 emissions exceeding its yearly target for each car registered they are fined 95 per g km of excess emissions.5 Even the most efficient ICE fleets will not meet these new standards without a 30% 40% penetration of zero emission EVs among new car sales.6 Some countries have gone as far as instituting 100% zero emission vehicle targets.7 Norway has been the most aggressive with a planned ban on ICE sales by 2025 and six countries8 are expected to follow suit by 2030. Eleven countries have endorsed the EV30 30 campaign 9 which targets a collective 30% market share for electric vehicles by 2030.10 Accordingly all the major car manufacturers now have clear commitments towards EVs. But debilitating up front costs have been damaging to the industry. Also hampering the move towards EVs are their profit margins which are about half those that run on petrol. Racing ahead China s automobile policies The move towards EV manufacturing has been a stated strategic goal for China since 2009 a reminder that China is a very long term thinker and it is both the biggest EV manufacturer and consumer in the world today Display 4 . DISPLAY 4 China leads in both production and sales of electric vehicles Source Nic Lutsey Mikhail Grant Sandra Wappelhorst Huan Zhou. Power Play How Governments Are Spurring the Electric Vehicle Industry. International Council on Clean Transportation May 2018 https theicct.org sites default files publications EV Government WhitePaper 20180514. pdf. Europe electric vehicles sales in 2017 are estimated by aggregating sales in Germany France U.K. Norway and the Netherlands. Circle sizes are proportional to the percentage of global electric vehicle production. This July six cities and nine provinces accounting for 60% of Chinese car sales moved from stage 5 emission standards to stage 6 a year ahead of schedule.11 They did so in order to conform to the central government s desire to combat smog. The acceleration of target dates meant that auto suppliers were absolutely unprepared. In May 2019 only 21% of cars in China met the stage 6 standards and consumers began to steer clear of stage 5 cars out of concern that they would have no resale value. The resulting disruption contributed to China s drop in demand. While the worst is likely over we don t expect a rebound this year. Meanwhile other parts of China will be adopting new standards in July 2020. Sales should start to pick up over time but it will take years for consumers and manufacturers to adjust to new emissions standards Display 5 . DISPLAY 5 Steady climb Source CAAM Morgan Stanley Research estimates . Forecasts estimates are based on current market conditions subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass. Stuck in neutral The consumer quandary Meaningful consumer interest in EVs has also been slow to develop. Policies and taxes are directing consumers away from traditional cars yet EVs are not yet fully viable alternatives. Prices are not yet competitive and supply and variety are quite limited. While the driving range of EVs is increasing rapidly charging infrastructure is limited and the length of time needed to recharge an EV battery is problematic for longer trips. With uncertainty around such big ticket purchases consumers may find it easier to defer their buying decisions. In the longer term we expect demand to pick up. Disruptive trends like car sharing have made car ownership somewhat less important but they have not yet upset the norms around car ownership. In the U.S. for example Generation Z still wants to own a car. Germany may be an exception While the population of Germans between 17 and 25 decreased by 7.5% between 2007 and 2018 the corresponding drop in licenses was roughly 26%.12 Path forward will be a slow U turn As the auto industry slogs through disruptive terrain the economic implications are likely to follow a U shaped pattern The industry s rough downhill road over the past 18 months will eventually evolve into an upward growth trajectory. In our view necessary investments in infrastructure and production facilities will eventually fuel significant economic growth. The cumulative investment required to meet the EV charging infrastructure needs in the three largest car markets the U.S. the EU and China is estimated at $50 billion.13 In the EU for example there are only about 150 000 public charging points for electric cars at least 2.8 million will be needed by 2030.14 That translates into a 20 fold increase within the next 12 years. The employment repercussions are a different story. EV manufacturing tends to be automated requiring significantly fewer workers and the assembly line skills needed for building ICE cars are not readily transferable to producing EVs. Auto manufacturers are likely to adapt but it is smaller companies and employees in the ICE vehicle supply chain which will suffer given EVs require less parts. Longer term economic growth will result in employment growth but the magnitude of employment growth is unclear. Given how focused it is on ICE vehicles Germany appears most exposed to the transition to EVs and the government is well aware of the risk of a slowdown. However any fiscal stimulus from Germany is likely to be re active rather than proactive due to growth and political hurdles. Growth outlook actually needs to deteriorate more before policymakers will act as there are major constitutional hurdles to issuing debt beyond the current limits imposed by the constitution and their current political commitments. That said Germany doesn t even need to raise debt for stimulus. Their budget surplus as at December 2018 was 1.7% of GDP. Regional road map Looking at the global regions we see near term challenges CHINA With tentative attempts to re stimulate their auto industry China is likely to stabilise somewhat but not enough to see a significant near term recovery. EUROPE European performance depends on Germany but despite a budget surplus and growing concerns they do not appear in a rush to stimulate until growth deteriorates further. Combined with Brexit acting as a backup brake Europe seems unlikely to see a broad based recovery in sales and production in the near term. U.S. We have not seen any tangible plans related to the auto industry though there is some potential as we get closer to the 2020 election. JAPAN As one of the leaders in hybrids and energy efficient vehicles Japan s auto industry faces the fewest near term challenges. Stay off the highway for now The auto industry is going through a disruptive pivot. Despite hurdles countries aiming for zero emissions by 2025 will require significant investments quite soon that should have a stimulative effect. We expect to start seeing these investments and their effects kick in within the next two years. The trip to the growth side of the U is still beyond the reach of a single battery charge. In the short run and until prices drop further we would caution against investing in the auto industry. 1.

Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  A bit of optimism and sticker shock arrived in September. After exceptional performance in August September proved much more challenging as news flow turned less dire although not necessarily positive and government bonds were no longer so attractive. The eagerly awaited European Central Bank ECB and Federal Reserve Fed meetings finally arrived. While in no ways hawkish they did disappoint elevated expectations the ECB by cutting rates by only 10 basis points bps and the Fed with its guidance on future possible rate cuts . While their commentary did not preclude further policy accommodation in both cases there was a distinct element of caution with regard to further easing that unsettled bond markets. Somewhat surprisingly credit markets held up well with U.S. credit outperforming Euromarkets . Maybe hope for better economic performance and further ECB corporate bond buying overcame other disappointments. We view the sell off in core developed bond markets as a correction rather than the beginning of a bear market. It looks like government bond yields are settling into a range while we await the outcome of U.S. Chinese trade talks and more information about the direction of the global economy. Our best advice is to be close to neutral with a small optimistic bias. No global recession. Yields and credit are buys on weakness. Exposures should be concentrated where fundamentals are sound and valuations reasonable. On the developed sovereign side we prefer Australia Spain New Zealand and the U.S. probably most vulnerable to further bad news in emerging markets EM we like Brazil Indonesia Mexico and Peru.

Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of September 30 2019 Fixed Income Outlook Bond yields retraced a significant portion of their August rallies in September with core Euro yields hit particularly hard. We believe there were three principal reasons for the September sell off 1 Disappointment with Fed and ECB policy actions particularly with how they characterized likely future actions a recalibration upwards of future rate cuts occurred. 2 Valuations had become demanding making the market vulnerable to a correction. Yields had fallen to levels normally associated with recessions below what is appropriate for current economic conditions. 3 Economic data did not collapse. While a sustained improvement still seems distant the fact that things did not deteriorate more was positive. While the ECB delivered a comprehensive package of easing across rates including a rate cut tiering of ECB bank deposit rates forward guidance and open ended quantitative easing QE ECB post decision commentary came across as more hawkish in that the ECB was at the limits of their easing power. Further policy easing if required would be up to fiscal authorities. The fact that this was President Draghi s last meeting before handing over the reins to Christine Lagarde also did not help. We and the markets are not sure how the new leadership will perform. It may be the case that latent hawkishness suppressed by Draghi s leadership will now emerge. There was no significant economic data sufficiently different from what the market expected to cause our views to change. Weak business spending capex low business confidence worsening corporate margins and falling global trade have not gone away. While this weakness is predominately evident on the manufacturing industrial side of the global economy we are probably already in a technical manufacturing recession we are concerned that if it continues unabated it will undermine the one strength in the world economy U.S. and European households. Labor market data and consumer spending data bear close scrutiny. We still believe an actual economy wide recession is unlikely and this slowdown is more akin to the 2015 2016 situation when manufacturing contracted temporarily but resilience in the service sector kept the aggregate economy growing. U.S. unemployment is at decade lows as it is in Europe and wage growth is positive in real terms even if subdued relative to history. But we cannot be complacent about the risks. Labor markets cannot fight off continued weakness forever and there are some signs of the manufacturing contraction causing job losses. Moreover China is not acting like the global locomotive it has been in the past 10 years post global financial crisis. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policy have been more muted than in the past as Chinese authorities attempt to balance deleveraging reform efforts with fighting off the effects of the U.S. China trade situation. It seems Chinese authorities are content to stop slow additional weakness in the economy rather than try to return growth to previous years levels. Chinese macro policy bears watching. So economic data is not really improving. Trade wars Brexit and deteriorating business confidence have not gone away. Even if the U.S. and global economies escape outright recession they are vulnerable to unanticipated events. For example the strike on Saudi oil infrastructure could have been much worse in terms of its impact on oil and the global economy. This means that central banks will remain ultra vigilant in maintaining an easing bias. Over 15 central banks have cut rates this year. Only Norway has bucked the trend and actually raised rates but it is an unusual country in terms of its economic structure and does not tell us anything about what is likely to happen elsewhere. The big worry is that monetary policy is at its limits in terms of effectiveness. Low and falling rates do help lower borrowing costs and help debtors. But with global economic uncertainty high and U.S. China trade talks going nowhere at least at the time of writing it is difficult to convince people companies to borrow money on expectations of a brighter stronger future. While the effects of monetary policy at these low levels is debatable what we believe is not debatable is that central banks will continue to try meaning rates will keep moving lower if economic data deteriorate further. During this period of intense uncertainty we continue to look for signs indicators showing how the situation is going to evolve. We continue to believe the yield curve is the best barometer of market confidence. We think a measure of success e.g. reflation would be a steepening of yield curves. If monetary stimulus is working its magic curves should steepen. In the short term we seem to be coming into a period of greater calm. Apparently the U.S. and China will resume trade negotiations Italian politics have stabilized a hard Brexit at the end of October seems unlikely and November will see central banks easing once again. While we remain worried about the trends in place both in economic data and policies markets may settle down with government bond yields now range bound and credit and EM stabilizing. We would not advocate reducing exposures for now or increasing duration in government bond markets. Our best advice is to be close to neutral with a small optimistic bias. No global recession. Yields and credit are buys on weakness. Exposures should be concentrated where fundamentals are sound and valuations reasonable. On the developed sovereign side we prefer Australia Spain New Zealand and the U.S. probably most vulnerable to further bad news in EM we like Brazil Indonesia Mexico and Peru. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review Developed market sovereign bonds sold off in September reversing a portion of their August rally. The spread between the U.S. 10 year Treasury and 2 year note steepened by 5 bps as the market reacted positively to news of more constructive U.S. China trade talks and Brexit developments.1 While central banks remained in easing mode in September the tone was not as dovish as hoped. The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee FOMC decided to cut the fed funds target range by 25 bps and the interest on excess reserves IOER by an additional 5 bps to 1.80% on a divided vote caught between uncertainty over global growth and a domestic economy that is holding up well.2 The outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi presented an extensive stimulus package at the ECB meeting cutting the depo rate announcing open ended quantitative easing strengthening the forward guidance on interest rates making the terms of the TLTRO more generous and introducing reserve tiering for banks. However markets were disappointed in particular with the reluctance to cut interest rates further and dissenting views from some of the more hawkish members on the Governing Council. Outlook Global growth is likely to continue to be lower for the remainder of 2019. Central banks have become more accommodative although divided particularly in the U.S. and eurozone. We expect that to continue as uncertainty in the geopolitical and economic landscape remains prevalent. Three major risks we see to the outlook are Brexit U.S. China trade disputes and weakness in the manufacturing and trade sectors undermining the consumer. In this context we expect U.S. Treasury yields to remain well below 2%. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income asset performance was mixed in the month as a bounce in U.S. Treasury yields weighed on dollar denominated assets. Within the dollar segment the shorter duration corporate segment outperformed sovereigns and high yield outperformed the longer duration investment grade segments. EM domestic debt performance was also improved last month with a marginally positive contribution from EMFX.3 During the period oil prices were weaker metal prices were mixed and agricultural commodities were generally stronger. Aiding the broader risk appetite for the month was an easing in U.S. China trade tensions as both sides made goodwill gestures such as the U.S. delaying tariff implementation and China exempting tariffs on some previously designated products and purchasing U.S. agricultural goods. The slowdown in manufacturing and growth indicators prompted a global easing response from central banks and governments. Outlook We remain cautious on EM debt. U.S. China trade talks scheduled to take place on October 11 12 will likely influence market sentiment which has recently soured due to U.S. threats to restrict capital flows to China. The outcome of the October negotiations are difficult to predict with some observers leaning towards a scenario of near term escalation that is October 15 U.S. tariffs on China imports enacted followed by a potential truce at a leaders summit around the APEC conference in November. U.S. politics are also adding to volatility as impeachment proceedings initiated by the Democratic Party in the Lower House may impact Trump s calculus vis vis China as well as making the ratification of the USMCA agreement more challenging. This fragile backdrop for trade is weighing on global growth with the latest high frequency activity indicators mostly trending down and prompting central banks in both developed and emerging countries as highlighted previously to double down on monetary policy accommodation. Easy monetary policy should be supportive of long duration positions whereas we are less constructive on the performance of EM currencies as we envision an appreciating U.S. dollar in the near term supported by a tighter monetary policy stance by the Fed relative to other central banks and heightened risk aversion. Credit Monthly Review September saw corporate spreads marginally tighter overall reflecting the lack of market conviction to move in either direction. September also saw a partial reverse in the risk free German government bond rally seen in August driving the negative absolute return in the month. The key drivers in the month were 1 ECB QE announcement due to start on November 1 at 20bn per month plus a rate cut and tiering for deposits which should benefit banks 2 global economic data that was slightly better than expectations as compared to previous months. While you could argue this was only a function of lower expectations the surprises indices did improve in September 3 multiple political events including the attack on a Saudi refinery BREXIT news Italian politics and U.S. China trade all impacted sentiment on given days but net over the month the impact was limited. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S Corporate Index closed 6 bps tighter in September to end the month at 114 bps over government bonds.4 Financials underperformed non financials in the month. In terms of excess returns versus government bonds the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index generated an excess return of 0.42% in September. U.S. investment grade outperformed the European market. Euro IG widened 1 bp to 109 bps in September as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index. As opposed to U.S. credit financials closed flat and outperformed non financials which closed 1 bp wider. Investment grade credit year to date performance remains positive with European investment grade 42 bps tighter outperforming U.S. investment grade which are 39 bps tighter. Relative to governments of equal duration the U.S. IG Index has returned 4.07% year to date while European IG has returned 3.87%.5 Outlook While valuations have richened with the strong performance in 2019 to date we see a number of signals that macro risk is rising. This includes risk of a hard BREXIT continued trade negotiations between U.S. China with no resolution and weak global manufacturing data overall PMIs . However our base case does not call for a recession. Rather we expect continued low global growth and low inflation supported by low real rates and easy financial conditions. Securitized Monthly Review While geopolitical events and global economic data remain concerning U.S. economic data continues to be resilient with historically low unemployment rising wages and healthy spending rates and increasing home sales continue to be buoyed by lower mortgage rates. Current coupon agency mortgage backed security MBS nominal spreads widened 4 bps in September to 101 bps above interpolated U.S. Treasuries.6 The duration of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index lengthened 1 3rd of a year to 2.73 years during September as rates rose slightly during the month. However mortgage prepayments continue to accelerate reflecting the recent lows in mortgage rates.7 National mortgage rates rose 3 bps in September to 3.72% but remain very low by historical comparison. Mortgage rates are 36 bps lower in 2019 and 110 bps lower than the recent peak reached in November of last year.8 Pay ups for specified pools remain strong as investors look for pools with lower prepayment risks. The Fed s MBS portfolio shrank by $22 billion during September to $1.467 trillion and is now $170 billion lower year to date.9 Mortgage mutual funds saw net inflows of $580 million in September increasing year to date net inflows to $12.7 billion.10 Mortgage mutual fund inflows in 2019 have surpassed the 2018 mutual fund outflows of $7.6 billion and have helped partially offset the decline in Fed MBS holdings. But overall the Fed s balance sheet MBS reductions which have increased to roughly $20 billion each month in the recent months significantly outweigh incremental fund inflows and present a headwind for agency MBS valuations in 2019. Outlook Overall our outlook remains largely unchanged. We still have a positive fundamental credit outlook for residential and consumer credit conditions in both the U.S. and Europe but we have begun reducing some of our securitized credit exposure as concerns over a potential economic downturn become more pronounced. We remain slightly negative on agency MBS but we have been reducing our agency MBS underweight over the past few months. Agency MBS are under pressure from both increased prepayment risks from lower mortgage rates and also from the continued supply demand dynamics from the Fed continuing to reduce its MBS holdings and increasing market float by $20 billion per month. However agency MBS spreads have widened materially over the past few months reflecting these risks and now offer more comparable relative value. Much of the negative conditions for agency MBS seem to be priced in at this stage. 1 Source Bloomberg as of September 30 2019. 2 Source Bloomberg as of September 30 2019. 3 Source J.P.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",
      "Doc - Lemmatized:   a bit of optimism and sticker shock arrive in september . after exceptional performance in august september prove much more challenging as news flow turn less dire although not necessarily positive and government bond be no longer so attractive . the eagerly await european central bank ecb and federal reserve fed meeting finally arrive . while in no way hawkish do disappoint elevated expectation the ecb by cut rate by only 10 basis point bps and the fed with guidance on future possible rate cut . while commentary do not preclude further policy accommodation in both case there be a distinct element of caution with regard to further ease that unsettled bond market . somewhat surprisingly credit market hold up well with u.s. credit outperforming euromarket . maybe hope for well economic performance and further ecb corporate bond buying overcome other disappointment . view the sell off in core develop bond market as a correction rather than the beginning of a bear market . look like government bond yield be settle into a range while await the outcome of u.s. chinese trade talk and more information about the direction of the global economy . good advice be to be close to neutral with a small optimistic bias . no global recession . yield and credit be buy on weakness . exposure should be concentrate where fundamental be sound and valuation reasonable . on the develop sovereign side prefer australia spain new zealand and the u.s. probably most vulnerable to further bad news in emerge market em like brazil indonesia mexico and peru . display 1 asset performance year to date note usd base performance . source thomson reuters datastream . datum as of september 30 2019 . the index be provide for illustrative purpose only and be not mean to depict the performance of a specific investment . past performance be no guarantee of future result . see below for index definition . display 2 currency monthly change versus usd source bloomberg . datum as of september 30 2019 . note positive change mean appreciation of the currency against the usd . display 3 major monthly change in 10 year yields and spreads source bloomberg jp morgan . datum as of september 30 2019 fixed income outlook bond yield retrace a significant portion of august rally in september with core euro yield hit particularly hard . believe there be three principal reason for the september sell off 1 disappointment with fed and ecb policy action particularly with how characterize likely future action a recalibration upwards of future rate cut occur . 2 valuations have become demand make the market vulnerable to a correction . yield have fall to level normally associate with recession below what be appropriate for current economic condition . 3 economic datum do not collapse . while a sustained improvement still seem distant the fact that thing do not deteriorate more be positive . while the ecb deliver a comprehensive package of ease across rate include a rate cut tiering of ecb bank deposit rate forward guidance and open end quantitative ease qe ecb post decision commentary come across as more hawkish in that the ecb be at the limit of ease power . further policy ease if require would be up to fiscal authority . the fact that this be president draghi s last meeting before handing over the rein to christine lagarde also do not help . and the market be not sure how the new leadership will perform . may be the case that latent hawkishness suppress by draghi s leadership will now emerge . there be no significant economic datum sufficiently different from what the market expect to cause view to change . weak business spend capex low business confidence worsen corporate margin and fall global trade have not go away . while this weakness be predominately evident on the manufacture industrial side of the global economy be probably already in a technical manufacturing recession be concerned that if continue unabated will undermine the one strength in the world economy u.s. and european household . labor market datum and consumer spending datum bear close scrutiny . still believe an actual economy wide recession be unlikely and this slowdown be more akin to the 2015 2016 situation when manufacturing contract temporarily but resilience in the service sector keep the aggregate economy grow . u.s. unemployment be at decade low as be in europe and wage growth be positive in real term even if subdue relative to history . but can not be complacent about the risk . labor market can not fight off continued weakness forever and there be some sign of the manufacturing contraction cause job loss . moreover china be not act like the global locomotive have be in the past 10 year post global financial crisis . expansionary monetary and fiscal policy have be more muted than in the past as chinese authority attempt to balance deleveraging reform effort with fight off the effect of the u.s. china trade situation . seem chinese authority be content to stop slow additional weakness in the economy rather than try to return growth to previous year level . chinese macro policy bear watch . so economic datum be not really improve . trade war brexit and deteriorate business confidence have not go away . even if the u.s. and global economy escape outright recession be vulnerable to unanticipated event . for example the strike on saudi oil infrastructure could have be much bad in term of impact on oil and the global economy . this mean that central bank will remain ultra vigilant in maintain an ease bias . over 15 central bank have cut rate this year . only norway have buck the trend and actually raise rate but be an unusual country in term of economic structure and do not tell anything about what be likely to happen elsewhere . the big worry be that monetary policy be at limit in term of effectiveness . low and fall rate do help lower borrowing cost and help debtor . but with global economic uncertainty high and u.s. china trade talk go nowhere at least at the time of write be difficult to convince people company to borrow money on expectation of a bright strong future . while the effect of monetary policy at these low level be debatable what believe be not debatable be that central bank will continue to try mean rate will keep move lower if economic datum deteriorate further . during this period of intense uncertainty continue to look for sign indicator show how the situation be go to evolve . continue to believe the yield curve be the good barometer of market confidence . think a measure of success e.g. reflation would be a steepening of yield curve . if monetary stimulus be work magic curve should steepen . in the short term seem to be come into a period of great calm . apparently the u.s. and china will resume trade negotiation italian politic have stabilize a hard brexit at the end of october seem unlikely and november will see central bank ease once again . while remain worried about the trend in place both in economic datum and policy market may settle down with government bond yield now range bind and credit and em stabilize . would not advocate reduce exposure for now or increase duration in government bond market . good advice be to be close to neutral with a small optimistic bias . no global recession . yield and credit be buy on weakness . exposure should be concentrate where fundamental be sound and valuation reasonable . on the develop sovereign side prefer australia spain new zealand and the u.s. probably most vulnerable to further bad news in em like brazil indonesia mexico and peru . developed market dm rate foreign currency fx monthly review developed market sovereign bond sell off in september reverse a portion of august rally . the spread between the u.s. 10 year treasury and 2 year note steepen by 5 bps as the market react positively to news of more constructive u.s. china trade talk and brexit developments.1 while central bank remain in ease mode in september the tone be not as dovish as hope . the u.s. federal open market committee fomc decide to cut the fed fund target range by 25 bps and the interest on excess reserve ioer by an additional 5 bps to 1.80 % on a divide vote catch between uncertainty over global growth and a domestic economy that be hold up well.2 the outgoing ecb president mario draghi present an extensive stimulus package at the ecb meeting cut the depo rate announce open end quantitative easing strengthen the forward guidance on interest rate make the term of the tltro more generous and introduce reserve tiering for bank . however market be disappoint in particular with the reluctance to cut interest rate further and dissent view from some of the more hawkish member on the governing council . outlook global growth be likely to continue to be low for the remainder of 2019 . central bank have become more accommodative although divide particularly in the u.s. and eurozone . expect that to continue as uncertainty in the geopolitical and economic landscape remain prevalent . three major risk see to the outlook be brexit u.s. china trade dispute and weakness in the manufacturing and trade sector undermine the consumer . in this context expect u.s. treasury yield to remain well below 2 % . emerge market em rate fx monthly review em fix income asset performance be mix in the month as a bounce in u.s. treasury yield weigh on dollar denominate asset . within the dollar segment the short duration corporate segment outperform sovereign and high yield outperform the long duration investment grade segment . em domestic debt performance be also improve last month with a marginally positive contribution from emfx.3 during the period oil price be weak metal price be mixed and agricultural commodity be generally strong . aid the broad risk appetite for the month be an easing in u.s. china trade tension as both side make goodwill gesture such as the u.s. delay tariff implementation and china exempt tariff on some previously designate product and purchase u.s. agricultural good . the slowdown in manufacturing and growth indicator prompt a global easing response from central bank and government . outlook remain cautious on em debt . u.s. china trade talk schedule to take place on october 11 12 will likely influence market sentiment which have recently sour due to u.s. threat to restrict capital flow to china . the outcome of the october negotiation be difficult to predict with some observer lean towards a scenario of near term escalation that be october 15 u.s. tariff on china import enact follow by a potential truce at a leader summit around the apec conference in november . u.s. politic be also add to volatility as impeachment proceeding initiate by the democratic party in the lower house may impact trump s calculus vis vis china as well as make the ratification of the usmca agreement more challenging . this fragile backdrop for trade be weigh on global growth with the late high frequency activity indicator mostly trend down and prompt central bank in both develop and emerge country as highlight previously to double down on monetary policy accommodation . easy monetary policy should be supportive of long duration position whereas be less constructive on the performance of em currency as envision an appreciate u.s. dollar in the near term support by a tight monetary policy stance by the fed relative to other central bank and heighten risk aversion . credit monthly review september see corporate spread marginally tight overall reflect the lack of market conviction to move in either direction . september also see a partial reverse in the risk free german government bond rally see in august drive the negative absolute return in the month . the key driver in the month be 1 ecb qe announcement due to start on november 1 at 20bn per month plus a rate cut and tiering for deposit which should benefit bank 2 global economic datum that be slightly well than expectation as compare to previous month . while could argue this be only a function of low expectation the surprise index do improve in

that macro risk be rise . this include risk of a hard brexit continue trade negotiation between u.s. china with no resolution and weak global manufacturing datum overall pmi . however base case do not

      "Doc - Orig:  Dazzling investment returns make good headlines as do spectacular investment crashes. But seldom do we read stories about funds that excel in controlling volatility while delivering strong competitive returns. Yet managing volatility is the key to surviving a sharp market downturn. Most investment managers designate a benchmark to evaluate returns. Far fewer designate a benchmark focused on volatility. We are one of the few who do. Our investment process begins with risk. Depending on client preferences we specify a target range of volatility e.g. 4 10% within which we aim to maintain the investor s volatility1. A link between volatility targeting and higher Sharpe ratios Studies show that volatility has been negatively correlated to equity returns. As such it may make sense to allocate to lower risk assets when volatility is high or rising and to riskier assets when volatility is low or falling2. In fact data supports that many managers who do so often deliver a favorable Sharpe ratio which measures the amount of return generated given the amount of risk taken.3 The advantage of multiple asset classes Our multi asset portfolios hold a mix of equities fixed income commodity linked notes and cash. This flexibility to diversify across asset classes is critical in seeking to control risk. In fact research shows that global equities start to move in lockstep in distressed markets.4 Equity only managers therefore have no recourse other than to reallocate between their equity holdings and cash viewed by some as merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. A multi asset manager in contrast has multiple asset classes that can be rearranged to manage risk. A forward looking exercise Anticipating volatility is a hallmark of our investment approach. We continually survey macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions across the globe to identify potential sources of risk that could arise. Our goal is to adjust portfolio exposures before volatility strikes. We use the portfolio s equity allocation as the primary lever for adjusting its exposure to risk. When we expect some event such as an election political instability or change in monetary policy to cause a spike in market volatility we typically reduce exposure to equities. Conversely when market conditions normalize we restore the equity allocation to a more normal range. Case in point In the second half of 2018 there was an escalation in trade tensions that we anticipated could curtail global growth. By September we had also identified that divergence in equity market performance between the US vs the Rest of the World was approaching excessive levels. The US s outperformance was driven by a number of factors including the perception that the US is a safe haven and insulated from trade tensions. Expecting a market correction we decreased our equity allocation to reduce overall risk in our portfolios positioning towards more defensive assets. Final thought The psychological benefit of managing volatility For investors there is an emotional aspect of a strategy that aims to keep volatility within a specified range. Seeking to deliver a more consistent less volatile return stream can be of comfort to loss averse investors who might otherwise make rash decisions and sell prematurely. Strategies that aim to keep volatility within a pre set range could be of particular interest to high net worth investors. Given their aversion to volatility they might be willing to sacrifice some upside in order to help minimise sharp drawdowns. Keep in mind though there is no assurance that a strategy will attain the volatility target. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that the Strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. Equity and foreign securities are generally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to currency political economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. A currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. 1 Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index.

      "Doc - Orig:  It is well known that government bond yields in advanced economies tend to be closely linked to nominal GDP growth. It is less well known that this relationship has been unsteady over time. Economic theory as in Solow Growth Model postulates that bond yields should equal nominal GDP growth and many market participants concur. But in reality the relationship between government bond yields and nominal GDP we refer to this differential as the yield GDP gap has experienced six distinct regime shifts since the beginning of the 20th century. Our analysis shows that two factors best explain these regime shifts 1 the trend in inflation and 2 the pace of aggregate debt growth in relation to the size of the economy . In other words the faster debt grows relative to GDP the higher the bond yields for a given pace of nominal GDP growth. And the lower inflation has been in the prior period the lower the yield GDP gap will be. At present when taking into account a likely acceleration in debt to GDP growth which would contribute to structurally higher rates and the partially offsetting impact of low inflation over the last decade we estimate that over the next 5 years the average yield GDP gap will rise 80 basis points suggesting the U.S. 10 year yield could reach 3.5 3.7% by 2023. \n",

From a cyclical standpoint as global growth decelerates and the U.S. economy enters its late cycle stage health care s defensive characteristics should help it outperform. It has historically been profitable to discount worries about health care reform especially when valuation provides an attractive starting point and we believe this time is not different. We review our bull case for the U.S. health care sector below. Over the past 45 years the U.S. health care sector has outperformed the broader market. Its earnings and total returns have outpaced the market by 2.9% and 0.9% per year respectively since 1973. It has also outperformed during five of the last six recessions by 9% on average.2 While most other sectors have occasionally underperformed for prolonged periods of time e.g. energy in the 1990s and 2010s tech in 1970s and 1980s health care s underperformance has tended to be short lived and has often occurred early in the expansion after sharp outperformance during recessions. Unlike the broader market the sector s fundamental outperformance has not been based on margin expansion. In fact margins have shrunk since the 1970s from around a 10% net margin to 7.5% today.3 In contrast the broader market s net margins expanded from about 5.5% to 10% over that time period is proportionately benefiting from capital and labor outsourcing as well as lower interest costs.

      "Doc - Orig:  We choose to go to the moon . . . because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win. John F. Kennedy Climate change research generally examines tipping points or critical thresholds that once breached could accelerate the pace of change. But even today we are approaching many tipping points that cannot be ignored. They are playing out not only in the environment but also in political social economic and investment realms. Tipping point 1 Political We are edging ever closer to the political tipping point. Reaching it will be important if we are to mitigate the effects of climate change. Recently a number of reports gained attention for their updated predictions and proved rather sobering A 2018 IPCC report1 concluded that the threat of climate change is so significant and so immediate that we have just 12 years to make unprecedented changes to keep global warming to less than 1.5 C above pre industrial levels. Above this level the consequences are predicted to be far reaching and catastrophic. The UN Emissions Gap Report 2018 highlighted there is an enormous gap between what we need to do and what we re actually doing to prevent dangerous levels of climate change .2 Display 1 plots the projected global greenhouse gas GHG emissions under various scenarios we are predicted to overshoot the 1.5 C goal if we do not do more to reduce emissions. Display 1 2030 emissions gap between current policy and 1.5 C 2 C scenarios Source Climate Action Tracker CAT 2018 cited in the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP 2018 . The Emissions Gap Report 2018. United Nations Environment Programme Nairobi Global GHG emissions under different scenarios and the emissions gap in 2030. The current policy scenario estimates future global GHG emissions assuming that all currently adopted and implemented policies have been realised and no additional measures are taken. GtCO2e is carbon dioxide equivalency. Forecasts estimates are based on current market conditions subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass. Governments responses show many are burying their heads in the sand. During the December 2018 UN Climate Conference the U.S. Russia Kuwait and Saudi Arabia argued that the IPCC report should not be welcomed but merely noted . While the headlines surrounding the November 2018 White House report3 focused on the potential reductions in U.S. GDP by 2100 President Trump expressed scepticism. Either way any potential curtailment of GDP should make investors and citizens sit up and take notice. Until now many governments and politicians have largely ignored their responsibility to proactively deal with the challenge of climate change. We think mounting pressure from bodies such as the UN as well as from better informed citizens may now be moving us towards another tipping point which would mark a shift in attitudes and priorities. Tipping point 2 Social What if we just do nothing The consequences of inaction are potentially severe floods droughts fires hurricanes snowstorms and the hottest summers on record are already increasing mortality rates and creating havoc for industries and people. This is likely to exacerbate social tensions and could lead to further frictions and polarisation within society as different regions and segments of the population are disproportionately affected. Emerging markets being less able to adapt to climate related changes will likely suffer the most. Entire islands are being swallowed by rising sea levels. The island Republic of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean has bought land in Fiji to relocate its citizens due to rising seas. Yet Fiji itself is under threat relocating coastal villages inland. These are not the only climate refugees. On a much longer term horizon the World Bank estimates that climate change could ultimately lead to 140 million internal migrants in Sub Saharan Africa South Asia and Latin America.4 Some governments have also been facing pressure. Protests around the world calling for action on global warming have intensified but social unrest related to climate change is complicated. In France the populist gilets jaunes movement began as a protest against rising fuel taxes which the government had intended to help fulfill its commitments to tackle climate change under the Paris Climate Agreement. This led to a counter movement by the red scarves who are demanding an end to the violence. Ultimately the social unrest led to President Macron abandoning the policy. We have been factoring in these French protests in our investment considerations due to the political instability and its potential impact on European GDP. Clearly the climate related social tipping point presents social divisions. Not addressing climate change can lead to outcries for action yet addressing climate change can cause hardships that lead to protests such as the gilets jaunes movement. Doing nothing may delay unrest briefly but climate change will ultimately increase suffering climate refugees and social unrest regardless. Tipping point 3 Economic When it comes to economic tipping points in many ways the future is already here. The cost of renewable energy has fallen dramatically in many parts of the world. In the U.S. solar and wind energy are $54 and $51 per megawatt hour respectively Display 2 which is now competitive relative to coal at $66 per megawatt an hour. Both are less than a third of the cost of nuclear though for now gas still remains the least expensive source of energy. Display 2 The future is here Data source Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2018 Frankfurt School United Nations Environment Programme UNEP Collaborating Centre. $MWh indicates the US dollar cost per megawatt hour of energy. Subsidies and low borrowing costs for the initial required capital expenditure have helped solar and wind growth. However with rising interest rates led by the U.S. and the majority of energy investment outside the U.S. being U.S. dollar denominated we will need government policies to support further growth. The International Energy Agency IEA is predicting 70% of future global energy investments will be government driven.5 Clearly we are seeing a significant shift in energy production with a notable increase in renewable energy Display 3 . Display 3 Who are the biggest consumers of renewable energy www.iea.org renewables2018 Published 8 October 2018. The share of renewables in total final energy consumption in the European Union is calculated using the methodology outlines in IBRD World Bank and IEA 2015 Global Tracking Framework GTF 2015. The exact calculation and inclusion of specific energy flows may differ from those outlined in the EU Directive 2009 28 EC. Mtoe is million tonnes of oil equivalent. We should also consider the technological advances associated with renewables. There are increasing numbers of electric vehicles EVs which are getting cheaper while offering a greater range of choices. EVs are also more energy efficient and therefore emit less GHGs than internal combustion engines even if the electrical energy source is from a fossil fuel. However EVs require batteries which have low energy density and are heavy. For applications that require high energy density 6 like lorries hydrogen has the potential to emerge as a complementary technology. It would require a significant build out of infrastructure but Japan China and California are increasingly competing in this space. Japan in particular has been investing heavily in hydrogen. Toyota and Honda are leading the way in hydrogen fuel cell cars. In support of Japan s push to lead the world as a Hydrogen Society these advancements are planned to be showcased during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Hydrogen also potentially offers a solution to balance the power grid a challenge with which Beijing has had to contend. A weakness of electricity generated by renewable energy is that it tends to come in surges with big windstorms or a long spell of sunny days. Other issues include the cost of large scale batteries and the fast rate at which their energy depletes. Instead of wasting the excess electricity available during these intermittent surges it could be used to split water into hydrogen which can be stored in great quantities for long periods. That said hydrogen does have its own challenges as it is less efficient given the energy required to both create and store it. A final point worth noting is that while China is widely known to be the world s largest coal consumer it also leads new investment in renewables Display 4 . In fact China is already dominating in every area of new energies and had the most EVs in 2017 40% of the global stock period.7 Display 4 China the world s largest coal consumer also leads new investment in renewables Source Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2018 Frankfurt School United Nations Environment Programme UNEP Collaborating Centre. New investment volume adjusts for re invested equity. Total values include estimates for undisclosed deals. Investor demand and implications As these political social and economic tipping points bring disruptive changes in the energy and auto sectors across different regions the question becomes How should investors respond Enough are asking that question to drive markets to a fourth tipping point investor demand. Within the last few years investors have been increasingly demanding greater incorporation of environmental social and governance ESG considerations in their investments. While fossil fuel companies clearly face direct headwinds the impact on other sectors should not be ignored. The insurance industry which is facing greater risks of loss from floods and hurricanes is also subject to potential legal risks. For example if future regulations deem oil companies to be liable for their contributions to climate change there is an argument that this is a general liability matter for which oil companies already have insurance against damaging lawsuits and penalties. Climate change related issues can increase political uncertainty and have implications across a portfolio s broad asset allocation. Investors should consider this factor during the asset allocation process. For instance the gilets jeunes movement contributed to the already heightened political uncertainty in Europe in 2018. Within sectors we believe it is worth differentiating between companies. For example within the energy sector it makes sense to distinguish between oil and gas companies with poor climate risk management and those with stronger ESG scores.8 One solution we have found to address this while preserving global diversification is to remain sector neutral. We do this by keeping sector weights in line with those of the equity indices that we follow but within those sectors tilting our portfolio holdings towards higher scoring more ESG friendly companies. Climate change Not just a long term problem The current U.S. President withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has at times denied the threat of climate change. Therefore the U.S. government s response to climate change as with that of many other governments has been insufficient. However across the rest of the world there are some who are beginning to participate in the green race in a way that echoes a former U.S. president John F. Kennedy s exhortation of urgency for American leadership in a different race. In a speech that marked a tipping point in the Apollo space programme JFK rallied the nation We choose to go to the moon. . . because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win. Many are starting to realise that the need to tackle climate change is an issue that can no longer be postponed. We have reached a number of tipping points already political social economic and investment. There is no need to wait a century or a decade to see the effects. The consequences are unfolding right now across the planet. Investors should be taking advantage of the opportunities presented by these disruptions while protecting their portfolios from the adverse consequences. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",

gilet jaunes movement begin as a protest against rise fuel taxis which the government have intend to help fulfill commitment to tackle climate change under the paris climate agreement . this lead to a counter movement by the red scarf who be demand an end to the violence . ultimately the social unrest lead to president macron abandon the policy . have be factor in these french protest in investment consideration due to the political instability and potential impact on european gdp . clearly the climate relate social tipping point present social division . not address climate change can lead to outcry for action yet address climate change can cause hardship that lead to protest such as the gilet jaunes movement . do nothing may delay unrest briefly but climate change will ultimately increase suffer climate refugee and social unrest regardless . tipping point 3 economic when come to economic tipping point in many way the future be already here . the cost of renewable energy have fall dramatically in many part of the world . in the u.s. solar and wind energy be $ 54 and $ 51 per megawatt hour respectively display 2 which be now competitive relative to coal at $ 66 per megawatt an hour . both be less than a third of the cost of nuclear though for now gas still remain the least expensive source of energy . display 2 the future be here data source global trends in renewable energy investment 2018 frankfurt school united nations environment programme unep collaborating centre . $ mwh indicate the us dollar cost per megawatt hour of energy . subsidy and low borrowing cost for the initial require capital expenditure have help solar and wind growth . however with rise interest rate lead by the u.s. and the majority of energy investment outside the u.s. be u.s. dollar denominate will need government policy to support further growth . the international energy agency iea be predict 70 % of future global energy investment will be government driven.5 clearly be see a significant shift in energy production with a notable increase in renewable energy display 3 . display 3 who be the big consumer of renewable energy www.iea.org renewables2018 publish 8 october 2018 . the share of renewable in total final energy consumption in the european union be calculate use the methodology outline in ibrd world bank and iea 2015 global tracking framework gtf 2015 . the exact calculation and inclusion of specific energy flow may differ from those outline in the eu directive 2009 28 ec . mtoe be million tonne of oil equivalent . should also consider the technological advance associate with renewable . there be increase number of electric vehicle evs which be get cheap while offer a great range of choice . evs be also more energy efficient and therefore emit less ghg than internal combustion engine even if the electrical energy source be from a fossil fuel . however ev require battery which have low energy density and be heavy . for application that require high energy density 6 like lorry hydrogen have the potential to emerge as a complementary technology . would require a significant build out of infrastructure but japan china and california be increasingly compete in this space . japan in particular have be invest heavily in hydrogen . toyota and honda be lead the way in hydrogen fuel cell car . in support of japan s push to lead the world as a hydrogen society these advancement be plan to be showcase during the 2020 tokyo olympics . hydrogen also potentially offer a solution to balance the power grid a challenge with which beijing have have to contend . a weakness of electricity generate by renewable energy be that tend to come in surge with big windstorm or a long spell of sunny day . other issue include the cost of large scale battery and the fast rate at which energy deplete . instead of waste the excess electricity available during these intermittent surge could be use to split water into hydrogen which can be store in great quantity for long period . that say hydrogen do have own challenge as be less efficient give the energy require to both create and store . a final point worth note be that while china be widely know to be the world s large coal consumer also lead new investment in renewable display 4 . in fact china be already dominate in every area of new energy and have the most evs in 2017 40 % of the global stock period.7 display 4 china the world s large coal consumer also lead new investment in renewable source global trends in renewable energy investment 2018 frankfurt school united nations environment programme unep collaborating centre . new investment volume adjust for re invest equity . total value include estimate for undisclosed deal . investor demand and implication as these political social and economic tipping point bring disruptive change in the energy and auto sector across different region the question become how should investor respond enough be ask that question to drive market to a fourth tipping point investor demand . within the last few year investor have be increasingly demand great incorporation of environmental social and governance esg consideration in investment . while fossil fuel company clearly face direct headwind the impact on other sector should not be ignore . the insurance industry which be face great risk of loss from flood and hurricane be also subject to potential legal risk . for example if future regulation deem oil company to be liable for contribution to climate change there be an argument that this be a general liability matter for which oil company already have insurance against damaging lawsuit and penalty . climate change relate issue can increase political uncertainty and have implication across a portfolio s broad asset allocation . investor should consider this factor during the asset allocation process . for instance the gilet jeunes movement contribute to the already heighten political uncertainty in europe in 2018 . within sector believe be worth differentiate between company . for example within the energy sector make sense to distinguish between oil and gas company with poor climate risk management and those with strong esg scores.8 one solution have find to address this while preserve global diversification be to remain sector neutral . do this by keep sector weight in line with those of the equity index that follow but within those sector tilt portfolio holding towards high score more esg friendly company . climate change not just a long term problem the current u.s. president withdraw the u.s. from the paris climate agreement and have at time deny the threat of climate change . therefore the u.s. government s response to climate change as with that of many other government have be insufficient . however across the rest of the world there be some who be begin to participate in the green race in a way that echo a former u.s. president john f. kennedy s exhortation of urgency for american leadership in a different race . in a speech that mark a tipping point in the apollo space programme jfk rally the nation choose to go to the moon . . . because that challenge be one that be willing to accept one be unwilling to postpone and one which intend to win . many be start to realise that the need to tackle climate change be an issue that can no longer be postpone . have reach a number of tipping point already political social economic and investment . there be no need to wait a century or a decade to see the effect . the consequence be unfold right now across the planet . investor should be take advantage of the opportunity present by these disruption while protect portfolio from the adverse consequence . risk considerations there be no assurance that the strategy will achieve investment objective . portfolio be subject to market risk which be the possibility that the market value of security own by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio share may therefore be less than what pay for . accordingly can lose money invest in this portfolio . please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risk . there be the risk that the adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumption regard the underlie portfolio may be incorrect in light of actual market condition and the portfolio may not achieve investment objective . share price also tend to be volatile and there be a significant possibility of loss . the portfolio s investment in commodity link note involve substantial risk include risk of loss of a significant portion of principal value . in addition to commodity risk may be subject to additional special risk such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of great volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt security . currency fluctuation could erase investment gain or add to investment loss . fix income security be subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payment credit risk change in interest rate interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . in a rise interest rate environment bond price may fall . in general equity security value also fluctuate in response to activity specific to a company . investment in foreign market entail special risk such as currency political economic and market risk . stock of small capitalisation company carry special risk such as limited product line market and financial resource and great market volatility than security of large more established company . the risk of invest in emerge market country be great than risk associate with investment in foreign develop market . exchange trade fund etfs share have many of the same risk as direct investment in common stock or bond and market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index do . by invest in exchange trade fund etf and other investment fund the portfolio absorb both own expense and those of the etfs and investment funds invest in . supply and demand for etf and investment funds may not be correlate to that of the underlie security . derivative instrument can be illiquid may disproportionately increase loss and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance . the use of leverage may increase volatility in the portfolio . diversification do not protect against a loss in a particular market however allow to spread that risk across various asset class .\n",

      "Doc - Orig:  How I stopped worrying about inflation and learned to love tariffs Adapted from Dr. Strangelove Tariffs by definition increase the cost of goods so it would seem that they should lead to higher inflation. Yet during the recent U.S. China trade war inflation has actually fallen in the U.S. Why Tariffs Have Not Raised Inflation To explain this apparent paradox we examined the forces at play. What we found was a tug of war between the ostensibly inflationary effects of tariffs and their indirect deflationary impact as they have slowed global growth strengthened the USD and dampened commodity demand. Tariffs were first implemented by the Trump Administration in March 2018. To date $250 billion worth of tariffs have been applied driving the Chinese share of total U.S. imports down from over 20% historically to 17.5%.1 By the end of 2018 more than 46% of Chinese imports were subject to tariffs. And yet the U.S. has seen a downward trend in both headline and core inflation since July 2018. The trend is particularly apparent in U.S. headline inflation Display 1 which fell to 1.6% in June 2019.2 DISPLAY 1 Two recent downward trends Source Datastream Data as of 30 July 2019 In one corner Tariffs and wage growth Comparing the year over year YoY change in import prices shows that the after duty price paid by U.S. importers did in fact jump following the implementation of each tariff wave while the industries that were not subject to tariffs did not see any spikes. A recent study3 estimates that U.S. domestic manufacturing prices were 1.1% higher in 2018 due to tariffs via two channels 1. THE INPUT CHANNEL An increase in prices due to the increase in cost in imported intermediate goods 2. THE OUTPUT CHANNEL Pricing decisions made by producers in reaction to tariffs including price hikes made by domestic producers who seek to match higher priced tariffed goods At the same time wage growth has been on an upward trend since 2016 thanks to a tight labour market. The employment cost index is now close to 3% YoY growth its highest level since the global financial crisis. All things being equal this should also add to inflation pressures. In the other corner USD strength and oil weakness Pulling against the inflationary pressures of tariffs and wage growth have been the collective strength of the USD and weaker oil prices. The US dollar Index DXY is up 5.9% compared to end of June 2018. At the same time West Texas Intermediate WTI crude is down 17.4% since the end of June 2018 with the sharpest drop in the final quarter of 2018 when economic growth expectations weakened Display 1 . The inflationary pull of tariffs was also partially muted due to the fact that the first two tranches did not include any consumer goods and only 25% of the third related to consumer goods. With most tariffs falling on intermediate goods which are typically components of finished goods producers have been able to cushion consumers by absorbing some of the price increase. Furthermore even though prices for intermediate goods have risen they account for only a small percentage of the producer price index PPI . The prices of services which account for about 60% of the PPI in the U.S. have been remarkably stable. U.S. import prices which have a strong positive relationship with China s PPI are down 2.0% YoY as of June 2019 Display 2 . A lack of imported inflation is also having a dampening effect on the overall U.S. PPI Display 3 . DISPLAY 2 U.S. import prices track China s PPI index closely . . . Source Bloomberg Datastream. Data as of 30 July 2019. DISPLAY 3 . . . therefore falling prices in China are curbing the effect of tariffs Source Bureau of Labour Statistics Data as of 30 July 2019. U.S. import prices have been falling due to several factors CHINESE MANUFACTURING PPI Softening U.S. import prices have coincided with a material correction in Chinese manufacturing PPI which fell from 4.6% YoY in June 2018 to 0% YoY in June 2019 a 3 year low . This trend is largely a reflection of ongoing muted industrial demand A WEAKER RENMINBI RMB The combination of a stronger USD and a weaker RMB has also blunted the net effect of the tariffs. Last year s USD gains continue to keep a lid on core import prices while the 7% depreciation of the RMB vs the USD over the past 12 months has helped offset the face value of Chinese tariffs. Against this backdrop the U.S. consumer s resiliency has been further bolstered by low unemployment and broad wage gains. In a roundabout way the U.S. has been lucky in its timing weaker global growth which has contributed to PPI deflation and a strong USD have served to buffer the impact of tariffs. What happens next Until industrial demand picks up the tariffs effect on inflation is likely to remain muted. Furthermore the latest data suggests that industrial activity is continuing to slow around the world particularly in trade oriented regions. As of the end of June Japanese machine tool orders were down 38% YoY a rate of deceleration last seen in October 2008. German industrial activity has slumped to a seven year low and the July Manufacturing PMI fell to 43.1. Meanwhile companies are starting to feel margin pressures from rising labour and input costs. After years of healthy margins hovering at or above the 20% mark there appears to be little potential for margins to expand Display 4 . Although they started with a base of healthy margins a number of S P 500 companies cited margin pressures arising from higher labour costs and higher material input costs in their Q2 2019 earnings call.4 DISPLAY 4 Corporate margins Bumping up against a ceiling This is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the characteristics of a specific investment. Source IBES data as of 30 July 2019. To protect margins companies have two choices They may raise prices if they feel confident in the growth outlook or they may seek to cut costs. Based on the latest PMI data corporate sentiment and capital expenditure forecasts the second of these choices looks more likely in the near term. A dovish Fed and other forces in play In the absence of tariffs we would have had much stronger growth higher inflation and the Fed would not be easing. So despite being directly inflationary the tariffs have also been indirectly deflationary because they have dampened growth. Investors are hoping a dovish Fed can get businesses to invest again alleviating current deflationary pressures. And President Trump has been aggressively pushing for a more dovish Fed despite its independence. The upcoming U.S. election could also influence fiscal policy. If economic growth remains sluggish there will be political incentive for the administration to enact some sort of fiscal stimulus. The strong USD has also been a drag on growth. China s efforts to offset tariffs by devaluing their currency has contributed to USD strength. Looking ahead two other factors may put continued upwards pressure on the dollar Brexit uncertainty and the rising likelihood of a German recession. Nevertheless through further rate cuts the Fed could offset these pressures. Oil prices could also dampen growth if they climb from last year s lows. Manufacturing remains weak but there is always a risk of an oil related price shock e.g. if tensions with Iran increase that could push prices up. Wage growth is unlikely to trigger inflation unless U.S. growth accelerates. Lastly if growth does accelerate then businesses will need to ramp up investment to meet demand. Margin pressures could then force them to pass on full cost increases to the consumer rather than absorbing a portion of it themselves. The risk of tugging too hard Under normal conditions rising tariffs and wages would fuel expectations of higher inflation. They have in fact increased price pressure but that pressure has not been sufficient to offset weak global and in particular Chinese growth falling oil prices a strong dollar and the intentional absorption of price increases on intermediate goods by producers. These factors could be reversed by a dovish Fed and an election focused government stimulus. The Fed s current cutting could thus entail future risks. Typically the economic outcomes of Fed action are not observable until 12 18 months after the action. During that lag period some of the factors that have been depressing inflation could dissipate or reverse. If the Fed goes too far in responding to weak inflation today it may find itself having to backpedal aggressively. And the winner is . . . In the near term we expect the inflation limiting forces to win the current tug of war keeping inflation in the 1.6% 2.0% range. President Trump s recent threat to impose a 10% tariff on the outstanding $300bn of Chinese imports presented a real risk of more rapid inflation pass through given 60% of these imports are consumer goods. In contrast the latest macro data continues to highlight strong deflationary trends in producer prices PPI declined 0.3% and 0.6% YoY in July in China and Japan respectively . For the moment the deflationary demand shock is still outweighing the inflationary impact of tariffs. That said tariff tensions are unlikely to go away but may rise and fall substantially. Considering this the lack of fundamental catalysts and yet another blow to business confidence we are maintaining defensive positioning with relatively low exposure to equities. Therefore though investors may not love tariffs at least their inflationary effect currently appears muted given the other dynamics at play. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that the strategy will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. There is the risk that the Adviser s asset allocation methodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect in light of actual market conditions and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. The portfolio s investments in commodity linked notes involve substantial risks including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value. In addition to commodity risk they may be subject to additional special risks such as risk of loss of interest and principal lack of secondary market and risk of greater volatility that do not affect traditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase investment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In a rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall. In general equities securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalisation companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Exchange traded funds ETFs shares have many of the same risks as direct investments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as the value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds ETFs and other Investment Funds the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and those of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs and Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities. Derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio s performance. The use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio. Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes. \n",
      "Doc - Lemmatized:   how stop worry about inflation and learn to love tariff adapt from dr. strangelove tariffs by definition increase the cost of good so would seem that should lead to high inflation . yet during the recent u.s. china trade war inflation have actually fall in the u.s. why tariffs have not raise inflation to explain this apparent paradox examine the force at play . what find be a tug of war between the ostensibly inflationary effect of tariff and indirect deflationary impact as have slow global growth strengthen the usd and dampen commodity demand . tariff be first implement by the trump administration in march 2018 . to date $ 250 billion worth of tariff have be apply drive the chinese share of total u.s. import down from over 20 % historically to 17.5%.1 by the end of 2018 more than 46 % of chinese import be subject to tariff . and yet the u.s. have see a downward trend in both headline and core inflation since july 2018 . the trend be particularly apparent in u.s. headline inflation display 1 which fall to 1.6 % in june 2019.2 display 1 two recent downward trend source datastream data as of 30 july 2019 in one corner tariff and wage growth compare the year over year yoy change in import price show that the after duty price pay by u.s. importer do in fact jump follow the implementation of each tariff wave while the industry that be not subject to tariff do not see any spike . a recent study3 estimate that u.s. domestic manufacturing price be 1.1 % high in 2018 due to tariff via two channel 1 . the input channel an increase in price due to the increase in cost in import intermediate good 2 . the output channel pricing decision make by producer in reaction to tariff include price hike make by domestic producer who seek to match higher price tariff good at the same time wage growth have be on an upward trend since 2016 thank to a tight labour market . the employment cost index be now close to 3 % yoy growth high level since the global financial crisis . all thing be equal this should also add to inflation pressure . in the other corner usd strength and oil weakness pull against the inflationary pressure of tariff and wage growth have be the collective strength of the usd and weak oil price . the us dollar index dxy be up 5.9 % compare to end of june 2018 . at the same time west texas intermediate wti crude be down 17.4 % since the end of june 2018 with the sharp drop in the final quarter of 2018 when economic growth expectation weaken display 1 . the inflationary pull of tariff be also partially mute due to the fact that the first two tranche do not include any consumer good and only 25 % of the third relate to consumer good . with most tariff fall on intermediate good which be typically component of finished good producer have be able to cushion consumer by absorb some of the price increase . furthermore even though price for intermediate good have rise account for only a small percentage of the producer price index ppi . the price of service which account for about 60 % of the ppi in the u.s. have be remarkably stable . u.s. import price which have a strong positive relationship with china s ppi be down 2.0 % yoy as of june 2019 display 2 . a lack of import inflation be also have a dampening effect on the overall u.s. ppi display 3 . display 2 u.s. import price track china s ppi index closely . . . source bloomberg datastream . datum as of 30 july 2019 . display 3 . . . therefore fall price in china be curb the effect of tariff source bureau of labour statistics data as of 30 july 2019 . u.s. import price have be fall due to several factor chinese manufacturing ppi softening u.s. import price have coincide with a material correction in chinese manufacturing ppi which fall from 4.6 % yoy in june 2018 to 0 % yoy in june 2019 a 3 year low . this trend be largely a reflection of ongoing mute industrial demand a weaker renminbi rmb the combination of a strong usd and a weak rmb have also blunt the net effect of the tariff . last year s usd gain continue to keep a lid on core import price while the 7 % depreciation of the rmb vs the usd over the past 12 month have help offset the face value of chinese tariff . against this backdrop the u.s. consumer s resiliency have be further bolster by low unemployment and broad wage gain . in a roundabout way the u.s. have be lucky in timing weak global growth which have contribute to ppi deflation and a strong usd have serve to buffer the impact of tariff . what happen next until industrial demand pick up the tariff effect on inflation be likely to remain mute . furthermore the late datum suggest that industrial activity be continue to slow around the world particularly in trade orient region . as of the end of june japanese machine tool order be down 38 % yoy a rate of deceleration last see in october 2008 . german industrial activity have slump to a seven year low and the july manufacturing pmi fall to 43.1 . meanwhile company be start to feel margin pressure from rise labour and input cost . after year of healthy margin hover at or above the 20 % mark there appear to be little potential for margin to expand display 4 . although start with a base of healthy margin a number of s p 500 company cite margin pressure arise from high labour cost and high material input cost in q2 2019 earning call.4 display 4 corporate margin bump up against a ceiling this be provide for illustrative purpose only and be not mean to depict the characteristic of a specific investment . source ibes datum as of 30 july 2019 . to protect margin company have two choice may raise price if feel confident in the growth outlook or may seek to cut cost . base on the late pmi data corporate sentiment and capital expenditure forecast the second of these choice look more likely in the near term . a dovish fed and other force in play in the absence of tariff would have have much strong growth high inflation and the fed would not be ease . so despite be directly inflationary the tariff have also be indirectly deflationary because have dampen growth . investor be hope a dovish fed can get business to invest

      "Doc - Orig:  Government bonds and the U.S. dollar continued their exceptional performance in August while other sectors and asset classes struggled. The reason rising anxiety about the global economic outlook and policy responses. The causes the U.S. China trade dispute escalated economic data weakened or did not improve as anticipated and there was uncertainty about future central bank actions. Importantly despite these issues high yield bonds and equities have weathered the storm well preserving strong year to date returns. In fact most fixed income assets including credit delivered positive returns in August. The problem much of these returns are due to the dramatic fall in bond yields which is unlikely to be repeated.

Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of August 30 2019 Fixed Income Outlook Anxiety is up. Economic data especially softer business confidence data continues to soften. Trade disputes are escalating not ending. Brexit will not go away. And August is a quiet month for central bank actions so we will have to wait until later in September to see exactly how they are going to respond. In particular the two most important central banks the Federal Reserve Fed and European Central Bank ECB will make important decisions this month. If policy actions do not meet market expectations a minimum of 25 basis points bps off the fed funds rate target in the U.S. and an across the board ECB easing consisting of rate cuts tiering of ECB bank deposit rates forward guidance and quantitative easing QE bonds credit and equities could have a challenging fall. Indeed the data flow is sufficiently ominous with signs that weak business spending capex and worsening corporate margins might begin to soften labor markets particularly in the U.S. While we still do not believe a full blown recession is likely cycle indicators are deteriorating amongst political uncertainty. Until now household economic strength supported by strong labor markets and low borrowing costs has been the bulwark against the negative corporate dynamics unleashed by the trade war. The U.S. economy and bond market are probably most exposed to further deterioration. Much of this is due to its exposure to the global economy and global trade. U.S. business confidence both in manufacturing and services has been falling faster than in most other areas in the world. For example U.S. purchasing managers export expectations have sunk over the past month. If actual export volumes follow their lead the drop would mimic that seen in full blown recessions. All is not lost. Over 15 central banks have cut interest rates this year. The fact that credit spreads are still tighter year to date and U.S. equities remain near their all time highs reflects confidence that the economic slowdown seen so far will be contained. But monetary policy is not all powerful. Tariffs and de globalisation have powerful supply side and aggregate demand effects. While we do expect central banks to continue to cut rates expanding their tool kit if necessary it is not clear it will work especially at this low level of yields. Indeed lower rates and forward guidance cannot overcome uncertainty about future economic relationships e.g. tariffs capital flows . During this period of intense uncertainty we continue to look for signs indicators showing how the situation is going to evolve. We continue to believe the yield curve is the best barometer of market confidence. We think a measure of success e.g. reflation would be a steepening of yield curves. If monetary stimulus is working its magic curves should steepen. In the short term we do seem to be coming into a period of greater calm. Apparently the U.S. and China will resume trade negotiations Italian politics has stabilized a hard Brexit at the end of October seems unlikely and September will see central banks easing once again. While we remain worried about the trends in place both in economic data and policies markets may settle down with government yields stuck in narrow ranges and credit and emerging markets EM stabilizing. We would not recommend reducing exposures for now or increasing duration in government bond markets. In the interim we believe a focus on fundamentals corporate sovereign and structure in the case of securitized assets will serve us best and in that regard countries that have strong and or improving fundamentals with reasonable valuations are best placed to weather this storm. On the developed sovereign side we continue to like Australia Spain and the U.S. in the EM sovereign space we like Brazil and Peru on the local side and selected smaller countries somewhat insulated from global trade issues on the external side. The USD should remain generally firm except in specific instances e.g. we like the Egyptian pound which has a relatively unique set of fundamentals supporting it. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review Developed market sovereign bonds rallied sharply in August with the yield on the 30 year U.S. Treasury dropping below 2% for the first time ever.1 The spread between the 10 year Treasury and 2 year note inverted further reigniting recession fears amongst investors.2 Globally the deterioration in U.S. China trade negotiations was the primary catalyst behind an unusually tumultuous August in the fixed income and equity markets. Other events such as Brexit developments under Boris Johnson and Italy s new government added to the ever present geopolitical uncertainty. Markets reacted positively to Italy s newly formed government while Brexit uncertainties negatively affected the pound over the course of the month. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to continue to remain under pressure for the remainder of 2019 supported by easier monetary policy. Central banks have become more accommodative importantly in the U.S. and likely in the Eurozone but the risk for fixed income markets is that the easing has now been fully priced in. Three major risks we see to the outlook are Brexit U.S. China trade disputes and weakness in the manufacturing and trade sectors undermining the consumer. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review Emerging markets fixed income asset performance was mixed in the month. Dollar denominated assets were aided by falling U.S. Treasury yields driving the outperformance of sovereigns over corporates and investment grade over high yield which posted negative returns. Local bond performance was positive but overwhelmed by currency weakness versus the U.S. dollar.3 The escalation of the U.S. China trade war in August a typically poor month for market liquidity exacerbated volatility. In addition weaker global economic data and a massive sell off in Argentinean assets following adverse election results for market favorite President Macri contributed to lower risk sentiment. The negative view on global growth prospects also manifested itself in commodity prices which were broadly lower in the period. Outlook We hold a cautious view of the near term outlook for EM debt. Market sentiment remains weak on the back of the unresolved China U.S. trade dispute weighing on global trade and investment. After the U.S. administration followed up on its threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports worth $112bn as early as September 1 and China retaliated via higher duties on imports of US crude oil and litigation before the WTO expectations for a major breakthrough at bilateral trade talks in Washington later this month are understandably low. Adding to a fragile global picture was Eurozone data that pointed to weakening growth with Germany likely falling into technical recession in the third quarter. Furthermore uncertainty is expected to remain high as we approach the final stage of the Brexit saga where we would not rule out a potentially disruptive outcome further muddling an already challenging backdrop for risky assets. On the other hand we believe that increased monetary policy accommodation by central banks in the developed and emerging worlds will partially cushion the negative shocks originating from trade disputes and weaker global growth. Credit Monthly Review August saw corporate spreads wider overall reversing most of the tightening seen in July as concerns over global economic growth slowdown offset global accommodative monetary policies stances. The key drivers in August were 1 expectations of easier monetary policy from central banks 2 increased trade war tensions 3 weak economic data globally and 4 increased political uncertainty driving negative sentiment in the U.K. on Brexit. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index closed 12 bps wider in August to end the month at 120 bps over government bonds. Financials outperformed non financials in the month. In terms of excess returns versus government bonds the U.S. IG Index generated an excess return of 1.05% in August. European investment grade outperformed the U.S. market reflecting expectations of ECB buying under a new QE program and of concerns over the U.S. economy slowing as signaled by the U.S. 2yr 10yr curve inversion in late August. Outlook While valuations have tightened in the strong performance in 2019 to date we see a number of signals that macro risk is rising. This includes increased risk of a hard Brexit no likely resolution to U.S. China trade negotiations and weak global manufacturing data PMIs . Uncertainty makes the short term outlook for corporate earnings less clear. Our base case does not call for a recession rather we expect continued low global growth and low inflation supported by low real rates and easy financial conditions. We expect increased supply in September post the summer lull however technicals remain supportive overall and we expect conservative risk positions across the street and steady inflows into credit to keep the risk of forced liquidations low. Securitized Monthly Review Agency mortgage backed securities MBS materially underperformed in August with MBS spreads widening 12 bps in August to 97 bps over U.S. Treasuries of comparable duration. Lower rate levels are causing prepayment expectations to increase substantially putting pressure on the asset. Mortgage prepayments have already begun to accelerate and are expected to increase from current levels as rates have continued to decline with mortgage rates hitting their lowest levels since 2016. Pay ups for specified pools continue to grow as investors look for pools with lower prepayment risks. Agency MBS mutual funds continue to receive steady inflows receiving over $1 billion net inflows in August.4 These inflows have helped offset the Fed s MBS portfolio run off but are still relatively small when compared to the $20 billion per month decline in Fed MBS holdings. Outlook Overall our outlook remains largely the same. We still have a positive fundamental credit outlook for residential and consumer credit conditions in both the U.S. and Europe but we have begun reducing some of our securitized credit exposure as concerns over a potential economic downturn become more pronounced. We remain slightly negative on agency MBS but we have been reducing our underweight over the past few months. Although agency MBS are under pressure from increased prepayment risks from lower mortgage rates and also due to the Fed continuing to reduce its MBS holdings increasing market float by $20B per month spreads have widened materially over the past few months reflecting these risks and now offer more comparable relative value. Much of the negative conditions for agency MBS seem to be priced in at this stage. We continue to have a mixed view on commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS overall the sector seems marginally expensive on a risk adjusted basis but there are still a number of idiosyncratic opportunities that look compelling. 1 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of August 31 2019 2 Source Bloomberg Barclays data as of August 31 2019 3 Source JP Morgan as of August31 2019 4 Source Lipper US Fund Flows data as of August 31 2019. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  February proved to be a month of consolidation after January s remarkable comeback. Performance in government bonds varied U.S. Treasury and German government bond yields modestly increased while Australian and Spanish government yields decreased. Nongovernment sectors also consolidated their stellar January performance. This is not surprising as markets needed to digest the flow of news central banks becoming more dovish economic data still weakening while geopolitical risks centered on U.S. China trade negotiations and Brexit continued to hang over markets. Growing optimism that both issues are likely to be resolved in market economy friendly ways also helped the rally in risk markets continue. But as we all know the proof is in the pudding. Asset prices cannot continue to rally unless fundamentals eventually move in a favorable direction. And on this front ambiguity reigns. Industrial data is still weakening albeit with modest signs that the worst may be past but the lagged effects of previous monetary tightening particularly in the United States are still to be felt. That said the U.S. Federal Reserve Fed must be relieved that financial conditions have eased reducing pressure to be even more dovish. With risk assets having performed well and reasonable uncertainty remaining about the direction of economies and political negotiations we have not increased our risk exposures and continue to remain neutral on overall interest rate positioning. We expect more clarity in the weeks and months ahead and assuming prices are right we will make adjustments. Display 1 Asset Performance Year To Date Note USD based performance.

Fixed Income Outlook While the generally benign market conditions of January continued into February with risky assets performing well and government bond markets only modestly weaker the outlook in March is more uncertain as valuations are not as cheap as they were and the macro outlook remains uncertain. There is some evidence that the Chinese and eurozone economies are bottoming but the evidence is at best mixed with data relating to the manufacturing sector or to trade generally surprising to the downside while labor market and consumer demand releases have been more positive. Q4 earnings releases were generally better than expected but analysts have been revising down their forecasts. Other macroeconomic risks like Brexit remain unresolved and while there appears to be progress on the U.S. and China achieving a trade deal the market is already discounting good news on this front. Similarly subdued inflation means central banks are not under pressure to tighten monetary policy rapidly if at all but the market has already priced this in. The Fed is not priced to raise interest rates at all in 2019 and European Central Bank ECB rate hikes have also been pushed out into 2020. In fact the ECB is expected to ease monetary conditions by providing new lending facilities to replace maturing targeted long term refinancing operations TLTRO programs but given the market is already anticipating such measures the impact on markets in particular Italian banks and BTPs may be modest if announced but severely negative if not. So while the environment for risky assets is still positive it is less so than it was before and we have reduced our exposure to corporate credit and emerging markets EM . We think the case for owning these asset classes is still positive EM should be supported by the Chinese and eurozone economies bottoming a potential China U.S. trade deal as well as low inflation should keep developed economy central banks accommodative and in turn enable developing economy central banks to run looser monetary policy than they otherwise would. Credit is supported by robust earnings reports a potential renewal of TLTRO facilities by the ECB and expectations of a U.S. recession being continually pushed out aside from a flat yield curve very few indicators suggest a recession is likely within the next 12 24 months . In securitized markets we are more exposed to credit oriented product and are underweight agency mortgage backed securities MBS due to supply concerns from the Fed normalizing its balance sheet. However we will need clearer evidence that the economic growth outlook is indeed improving for the risky asset rally to be sustained through the year as well as the expectation that central banks will not tighten very quickly. In government bond markets we have moved to a neutral stance. The market has already priced in the shift from gradual monetary policy normalization to being more accommodative and with yield curves very flat so that carry is modest and valuations very rich relative to history it is difficult to be bullish on the asset class. At the same time the downside risks look limited if inflation remains subdued and developed economy government bonds play an important potential diversification 1 role in portfolios doing well when most other assets do badly. One market where the outlook is particularly uncertain is the U.K. gilt market where tightening labor market data would normally have caused the Bank of England BoE to raise rates several times already. However uncertainty around Brexit has put monetary policy on ice. If the current political uncertainties can be resolved positively then the market may have to price in a far faster pace of rate hikes. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review In February risk assets rallied and investor sentiment continued to recover. Global 10 year yields rose in the U.S. U.K. and Germany while yields fell in Australia New Zealand and Japan. A slowdown in global growth remained a concern despite a rebound in consumer confidence. The U.S. Dollar USD increased marginally against other G10 currencies with the notable exception of sterling GBP which strengthened on expectations that the probability of a disorderly U.K. no deal exit from the European Union EU had decreased. Outlook U.S. growth is likely to be lower but not collapse in 2019 as the fiscal impulse wears off and the lagged effect of higher rates bite. Recent speeches from Fed policymakers give us further confidence that they are cognizant of the risk of tightening monetary policy too far and the need to move at some point in the near future to a more data dependent policy. We don t expect any substantial policy changes in the near future given our outlook of a tame inflation path for the next 12 months. It is therefore likely that the market may also acknowledge that the peak in the U.S. Treasury 10 year yield is likely to be below 3.50 percent and the low likely above 2.50 percent. In the shorter term despite the dip lower toward the end of December we believe that the U.S. 10 Year Treasury yield is likely to spend a majority of the next few months between 2.60 and 3.00 percent. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income asset returns were mixed in February as EM currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar while local bond performance and external debt returns were positive. Within the hard currency segment high yield outperformed investment grade and corporates outperformed sovereigns. Optimism for the U.S. China trade talks was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump s announcement that the U.S. would delay the March 1st deadline for the implementation of additional tariffs. China s government also signaled that it would increase commodity purchases from the U.S. Given the weaker inflation and external backdrop many EM central banks have turned more dovish which should allow for selective rate cuts to support economic growth. Outlook We remain constructive EM debt over the coming weeks predicated on several factors. Firstly the latest high frequency data in China and the eurozone suggest that activity may have already bottomed out. Secondly the absence of global inflationary pressures combined with a moderation in growth is prompting central banks in the developed world to postpone or abandon plans for monetary policy normalization. Thirdly the solid year to date performance of EM debt assets which took place amid a largely stable dollar should be buoyed in the future provided our expectation of USD weakness begins to materialize. Finally the U.S. China trade conflict a major source of uncertainty last year appears to be heading toward a provisionary agreement boosting sentiment for risky assets in the near term. Credit Monthly Review The recovery of credit markets continued in February as global investment grade and high yield spreads continued to rally back from last quarter s weakness. Over the course of February markets digested 4Q earnings that were decent overall with few signs of material deterioration. Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization EBITDA grew at a slower pace as has been expected but remained sufficient to keep leverage broadly unchanged. These results coupled with no meaningful negative surprises on the macroeconomic front helped to allow the year to date rally to continue. Outlook Fourth quarter earnings which have been stable on balance coupled with solid 4Q U.S. gross domestic product GDP data and improving sentiment have helped to create a supportive environment for the credit markets. As we have been saying for some time a near term recession remains unlikely defaults rates will remain low and earnings growth while slowing should support deleveraging where necessary. The Fed remains dovish and has recently discussed inflation targeting a development that if adopted is likely to lower the likelihood of rate hikes even further. Outside the U.S. the ECB also remains dovish and is considering another round of TLTROs while China looks to relax policy as well. Easier monetary policy will help to extend the cycle supporting the corporate sector. Securitized Monthly Review Mortgage and securitized markets performed relatively well in February as interest rates drifted higher and credit spreads tightened across most sectors. Agency MBS outperformed Treasuries again in February as the stable rate environment and low volatility continues to minimize the embedded option cost and negative convexity of agency MBS. Credit sensitive securitized sectors outperformed agency MBS as fundamental credit conditions remain supportive and higher yields carry continue to drive outperformance. Outlook Mortgage and securitized markets are off to a decent start in 2019 although lagging behind the bounce back performance in many other markets that were hit harder in 2018. From a fundamental perspective we believe the U.S. economy is strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments. We are underweight agency MBS due to potential supply headwinds the sector could face as the Fed has ended its MBS purchases and U.S. banks could potentially reduce their agency MBS holdings if their risk based capital requirements are eased. Agency MBS have performed reasonably well year to date outperforming Treasuries as interest rate volatility remains low and mortgage option costs are minimized as a result. We continue to expect a benign rate volatility environment for 2019 which should continue to benefit agency MBS in 2019 but this benefit could be offset by the supply pressure from the Fed balance sheet run off. Overall we expect agency MBS to continue to outperform Treasuries but underperform credit oriented securitized opportunities. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

cycle support the corporate sector . securitized monthly review mortgage and securitized market perform relatively well in february as interest rate drift high and credit spread tighten across most

      "Doc - Orig:  With volatility on the rise why are you suggesting that investors consider markets outside of the U.S. Portfolio Solutions Group PSG Two key reasons are the increased opportunity set and the potential for risk mitigation. More than half of the world s investable markets are outside the U.S. and investors who focus exclusively on the U.S. may be missing out on 60% of the world s investment opportunities.1 In certain segments of the market the gap is even greater the international small cap universe for example is double that of the U.S.2 International investing allows for a wider breadth of investments and potentially more rewarding investment opportunities. Increased geographic diversification may also offer some downside risk mitigation as the relative performance of U.S. vs. international stocks has historically alternated. While U.S. equity markets have done remarkably well since 2008 recency bias may cause investors to forget that 2000 2010 was referred to as the lost decade due to their poor performance Display 1 . With low international correlations diversified portfolios have provided more consistent and stable investment results over the long run than narrower domestic markets. Display 1 Regional Annualized Returns Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Please refer to important information disclosures and qualifications at the end of this paper. Investing involves risks including the possible loss of principal. Indexes do not include any expenses fees or sales charges which would lower performance. Indexes are unmanaged and should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Further the current macro political backdrop with trade wars across the globe is having an impact on globalization. One of the consequences of countries putting up new barriers to cross border trade and investment is that countries economies and therefore markets move in a less asynchronous manner. With correlations among regions declining the ability to move in and out of markets is increasingly important as is the ability to assess the relative value of each market and potential for alpha generation. In regards to implementation are there benefits to choosing a single global manager as opposed to say a number of regional managers PSG As previously alluded to we believe geographic diversification is both prudent and timely. A global manager has the ability to rotate geographies in a way that can smooth out volatility improve diversification and enhance returns. The ability to diversify may be particularly useful today Morgan Stanley Research suggests there is a 70% chance that the U.S. will move from expansion to downturn in the next 12 months while forward looking consensus expectations suggest attractive returns for non U.S. equities. With the ability to tactically allocate between U.S. and non U.S. equities a global manager removes the need for asset owners to make a series of regional asset allocation decisions that they may not be better suited to make and may not fully take into account overall portfolio balance. A global implementation coupled with specialist managers for certain inefficient segments of the market is thus likely to be a more optimal portfolio construction approach. Thank you for sharing your views. With more market volatility there is a view that international diversification increasingly makes sense and the benefits and actionable insights that you offered may be useful in helping advisors and their clients achieve their goals. Index Definitions The S P 500 Index measures the performance of the large cap segment of the U.S. equities market covering approximately 75% of the U.S. equities market.

The MSCI World Index is a free float adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the global equity market performance of developed markets. The term free float represents the portion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. The performance of the Index is listed in U.S. dollars and assumes reinvestment of net dividends. The MSCI Europe Index is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure developed market equity performance in Europe. The term free float represents the portion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. The performance of the Index is listed in U.S. dollars and assumes reinvestment of net dividends. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index MSCI EM is a free float adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets.

The performance of the Index is listed in U.S. dollars and assumes reinvestment of net dividends. Risk Considerations There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  After a disappointing 2018 and a somewhat traumatic December January was a welcome surprise for most investors. The strong performance of nearly all assets in January was truly astounding given the events at the end of last year. Equally important was the fact that government bonds rallied alongside risk assets. The very strong January performance naturally lends itself to a feeling of d j vu. Didn t we see this movie last year A great January followed by well we know what happened the remainder of the year. Not surprisingly market participants are a little skeptical that these good times can last. Moreover many issues generating problems in 2018 have not gone away Brexit populist politics more generally U.S. China trade tensions . How are things different We think there are two main differences. First central banks have changed their tune. They have noticed the deceleration in economic activity and become considerably more dovish. Second valuations outside government bonds are a lot more attractive than they were a year ago even if they are not as cheap as they were a month ago. We remain committed to be long risk assets notably in corporate credit and emerging markets. We will keep a close eye on political developments to make sure fundamentals are not derailed. The dramatic shift in U.S. Federal Reserve Fed communication means we no longer expect U.S. and core eurozone government bond yields to move much higher. Hence we have shifted to a neutral overall stance on duration although we also see potential for variation in performance across countries.

Display 3 Major Monthly Changes in 10 Year Yields and Spreads Source Bloomberg JP Morgan. Data as of Jan 31 2019. Fixed Income Outlook What a difference a month makes. The extremely adverse market conditions in December were replaced by very supportive ones in January. Not only did the S P 500 enjoy its best return month since October 2015 practically all asset classes delivered positive returns. The most obvious explanation for the turnaround is the change in tone from the Fed who at their January meeting communicated that after raising rates for eight straight quarters they may not raise interest rates at all in 2019. This significantly reduces the risks of a hard landing to the U.S. economy due to the Fed overtightening. The rally in many risky assets e.g. small cap equities pre dated the Fed statements. It would appear that many investors agreed with us that valuations were discounting an economic outcome that was far more severe than was likely to occur and many assets had become too cheap unless a recession was imminent. Nonetheless the shift in Fed tone was very important. It helped to reduce concerns that the Fed would tighten policy too far too quickly and fits with a broader theme of central banks moderating or outright reversing their tightening policies. Subdued inflation in all the major economies means that central banks are under little pressure to tighten policy quickly or to tighten at all. For example the U.S. labor market reports for December and January both reported very healthy increases in employment. However wage growth did not accelerate and the unemployment rate decreased as more workers joined the labor force. This suggests there is more slack in the U.S. economy and the Fed can be patient. On the whole economic data released in January disappointed with three notable trends. First the survey soft data tended to be weaker than the actual hard economic data releases. Given soft data tends to be less volatile than the hard data and hence a better indicator of underlying economic trends it may be flagging economic weakness that will soon become evident. Second U.S. economic data have been considerably better relative to expectations than data for other economies notably Europe. Third the weak data have primarily been associated with trade manufacturing and investment. Household consumption has generally remained strong as unemployment is low and wage growth has been rising albeit modestly. Generally the fixed investment and manufacturing sectors which are typically more volatile drive the business cycle. If they continue to slow it could cause a broader economic slowdown. However with household income growth solid in both the United States and Europe a recession or even higher probabilities of recession look unlikely. The shift in central bank policy expectations is important for our outlook on yields. We no longer think that the Fed and other central banks will tighten policy over the coming months. As a result we have turned neutral on duration. However we expect some variation in performance across markets. We think Australian rates have the most potential to stay low or fall further while we expect Canadian yields to rise more than in the U.S. In Europe we think U.K. yields can rise considerably given the tight labor market once a resolution for Brexit is found. We expect credit spreads to tighten across markets. Absent a recession we believe default rates are likely to stay low company earnings will continue to grow and liquidity should return to the market. We think concerns about high yield markets being swamped by a deluge of downgraded BBB companies are overstated as continued earnings growth will give them time to manage their debt profiles lower. However while we continue to position portfolios for long risk we are taking advantage of the more supportive conditions to incrementally sell positions we feel are vulnerable to a deterioration in fundamentals. The emerging market EM debt outlook we envisioned at the end of last year has materialized for the most part in the first month of 2019. At the time we argued that attractive valuations a backdrop of moderate global growth and subdued inflation coupled with a dovish Fed and USD weakness would support EM debt assets in 2019. The strong year to date performance inevitably raises questions about the sustainability of the rally. We remain cautiously optimistic on EM fixed income as the underlying premises of our investment thesis still apply though valuations have become less enticing. In securitized and mortgage markets we still believe the U.S. economy remains strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments. We remain underweight agency mortgage backed securities MBS due to continued supply demand concerns as the Fed has ended its MBS purchases and U.S. banks could potentially reduce their agency MBS holdings if their risk based capital requirements ease. Developed Market DM Rate Foreign Currency FX Monthly Review U.S. UK and German 10 year yields continued to fall in January by six six and nine basis points respectively.1 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeased investors early in the month signaling to markets that the Fed will be patient with the timing of future rate hikes. Powell s tone set the stage for the rest of the month quelling fears of tighter monetary policy. The two year to 10 year spread remained relatively unchanged compared to levels seen at the end of December at approximately 17 basis points and the USD saw broad based declines against developed market DM and EM currencies.2 In Europe growth data continued to come in weaker than expected particularly in Germany and Italy. The European Central Bank s ECB s view remains that the economic weakness is likely to be transitory and points to strong labor market data as a source of growth and inflation going forward. However they acknowledge things are not progressing as they envisioned and there are at least as much downside risk as upside. It seems increasingly unlikely the ECB will manage to raise interest rates this year more targeted easing is very possible. The U.K. continues to be driven by Brexit uncertainty. The risk of a no deal exit is increasing as the planned 29 March exit date approaches but it seems increasingly likely Parliament will force Prime Minister Theresa May to ask for an extension so that the exit can be negotiated in an orderly manner. Outlook U.S. growth is expected to moderate this year yet remain above potential. Even though the U.S. yield curve remains very flat it has yet to invert. This is helping to push expectations of the next U.S. recession well into 2020 or beyond. Fed policymakers stated that they will be patient and will likely keep rates on hold for at least the next few quarters and the next rate move would not necessarily be a hike. Corporate earnings U.S. China trade negotiations the debt ceiling and the possibility of a renewed government shutdown are likely to drive the macroeconomic outlook. Key issues will be if the economic performance of the U.S. and other countries continues to diverge and if the weaker trend in the soft economic survey data is confirmed in the actual hard economic data releases. We believe the U.S. 10 year Treasury yield is likely to trade between 2.65% and 3% for the next several months. Emerging Market EM Rate FX Monthly Review EM fixed income assets rebounded in January following a volatile 2018. Domestic debt led the way driven by currency strength versus the USD and local bond performance. Within hard currency assets high yield outperformed investment grade and sovereigns outperformed corporates. An improvement in EM sentiment was driven by attractive valuations optimism around U.S. China trade talks the easing measures announced by the People s Bank of China PBoC in December and a growing perception that the U.S. Fed hiking cycle may be over. Commodity prices also rose with double digit returns registered for crude oil followed by agricultural commodities and metals. Investment flows were positive primarily into hard currency followed by local currency and blended strategies. Issuers took advantage of the favorable market backdrop to issue with a variety of sovereign quasi sovereign and corporate deals priced during the month. Outlook The EM debt outlook we envisioned at the end of last year materialized for the most part in the first month of 2019. At the time we argued that attractive valuations a backdrop of moderate global growth and subdued inflation coupled with a dovish Fed and USD weakness would support EM debt assets in 2019. The strong year to date performance inevitably raises questions about the sustainability of the rally. We remain cautiously optimistic on EM fixed income as the underlying premises of our investment thesis still apply though valuations have become less attractive. Credit Monthly Review Global investment grade spreads rallied strongly in January recouping all of December s underperformance. While economic data and corporate earnings have been weak in spots and unremarkable in others spreads were simply too wide at the start of January for a nonrecessionary environment. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index narrowed by 26 basis points in January to end the month at 127 basis points over government bonds with financials and BBB nonfinancial credits leading the market tighter. As measured by excess returns versus government bonds the U.S. Investment Grade index generated an excess return of 1.83% for the month. European investment grade lagged the U.S. market but spreads also narrowed in January. Spreads on the Bloomberg Barclays Euro Aggregate Corporate Index tightened by 10 basis points to end January at 141 basis points relative to government bonds. Outlook As discussed last month with confirmation that a recession is not imminent we expect credit spreads to tighten. Absent a recession default rates are likely to stay low company earnings will continue to grow and liquidity should return to the market. Continued earnings growth will give BBB companies time to manage their debt profiles lower and we see the risks on the number of expected downgrades to BB as overstated. We continue to position portfolios long risk to take advantage of these conditions though we have been incrementally de risking portfolios on the heels of this rally. We do not expect spreads to retest cycle lows given the age of the business cycle and the lower average quality of the market and questionable technicals pose risks. Sector and issuer selection will be key decisions in 2019 as technology and behavioral change are evolving rapidly and are disruptive for many traditional industry business models. These concerns will keep us cautious and more tactical. Securitized Monthly Review After several months of a risk off environment mortgage and securitized markets stabilized in January. Mortgage and securitized spreads were slightly tighter but did not experience the more significant rebound that occurred in many other credit sectors in January. Returns in January came from a combination of interest rate movements spread changes and cash flow carry. Both agency MBS and credit sensitive sectors had similar aggregate performances in January but for different reasons. Rate movements largely propelled agency MBS performance while carry dominated credit oriented asset returns. Fundamental securitized credit conditions remain sound with low default rates healthy consumer balance sheets and stable housing markets. Outlook Mortgage and securitized markets are off to a decent start in 2019 although lagging behind the bounce in many other markets. From a fundamental perspective we still believe the U.S. economy remains strong with healthy consumer and real estate market conditions and we remain overweight credit oriented securitized investments. We remain underweight agency MBS due to continued supply demand concerns as the Fed has ended its MBS purchases and U.S. banks could potentially reduce their agency MBS holdings if their risk based capital requirements ease. Agency MBS spreads tightened in January after the Fed s statement which indicated a willingness to potentially change its balance sheet normalization plans. We believe the Fed will continue to unwind its balance sheet in the absence of severe economic distress and the excess supply of agency MBS will continue to put pressure on MBS spreads. RISK CONSIDERATIONS Fixed income securities are subject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest payments credit risk changes in interest rates interest rate risk the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity market risk . In the current rising interest rate environment bond prices may fall and may result in periods of volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. Longer term securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. In a declining interest rate environment the portfolio may generate less income. Certain U.S. government securities purchased by the strategy such as those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. It is possible that these issuers will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future. Public bank loans are subject to liquidity risk and the credit risks of lower rated securities. High yield securities junk bonds are lower rated securities that may have a higher degree of credit and liquidity risk. Sovereign debt securities are subject to default risk. Mortgage and asset backed securities are sensitive to early prepayment risk and a higher risk of default and may be hard to value and difficult to sell liquidity risk . They are also subject to credit market and interest rate risks. The currency market is highly volatile. Prices in these markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand for a particular currency trade fiscal money and domestic or foreign exchange control programs and policies and changes in domestic and foreign interest rates. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Restricted and illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities liquidity risk . Due to the possibility that prepayments will alter the cash flows on collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs it is not possible to determine in advance their final maturity date or average life. In addition if the collateral securing the CMOs or any third party guarantees are insufficient to make payments the portfolio could sustain a loss. \n",

Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market.

      "Doc - Orig:  Strong on Engagement Low on Carbon Built on Quality The trend toward sustainable investing has exploded over the last decade with an estimated $23 trillion in assets under management globally.1 With our focus on high quality companies with earnings resilience sustainability is key. In our view understanding and integrating environmental social and governance ESG factors is essential for successful compounding. In our view understanding ESG factors is essential for successful compounding. We believe material social and environmental risks are more important than ever given political and technological changes. Naturally any material ESG risk to the sustainability of a company s returns may pose a risk to the prospects for long term sustainable compounding. However many investors miss that companies with good governance and the ability to lead the way on social and environmental issues can also be a positive force for corporate success driving consumer loyalty and improving employee retention and stakeholder engagement. We believe that clients are increasingly looking for ESG funds to meet their investment requirements without any compromise to returns. Global Sustain is Morgan Stanley Investment Management s solution for this aiming to deliver compounding with a conscience. The strategy builds on the International Equity Team s existing foundation of high quality investing. It combines our historical focus on good governance our successful and regular engagement with company managements full integration of ESG into the investment process and the exclusion of certain industries that conflict with social or environmental considerations. Global Sustain includes 25 50 of the world s highest quality compounders at reasonable valuations. It is naturally carbon light given the avoidance of low return polluting sectors such as bulk commodities energy and gas and electric utilities. It has exposure to corporations leading the way in consumer and staff engagement through a focus on material social and environmental issues. It benefits from superior allocation of capital driven by good management and the right attitude to governance. Furthermore the strategy excludes controversial industries including tobacco alcohol weapons gambling adult entertainment and fossil fuels. Click on the pdf to read more. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Environmental and social issues are a significant risk to the continued success of compounders along with other changes such as technology. Companies that fail to look after their relationships with customers and regulators are playing fast and loose with their core intangible assets. CULTURE POLITICS REGULATION Companies are coming under increasing pressure from all sides to meet a growing number of standards guidelines and social demands. Failure to meet them can trigger public backlashes or boycotts when a company is seen to have failed. The resulting publicity can be devastating to a firm s reputation and profits. While product safety has always been a key concern there is now additional focus on the impact of products and services on the environment and society including climate change and ethical and sustainable sourcing. The attitude of the company on equality and discrimination can also be a source of vulnerability. It s not only customers that companies have to please governments too are weighing in. Regulatory backlashes have become increasingly severe towards companies that break the law or fail to meet regulatory standards just ask the banking sector which has been hit with $300 billion in fines since the global financial crisis in 2008. Political trends too suggest a less benign environment for corporations especially in the realm of antitrust and taxation. Strengthening populist movements are giving a voice to those concerned about market concentration and tax avoidance notably by large technology companies with complex corporate structures. BIG DATA BIG RESPONSIBILITY The volume of data available about all of us has exploded in recent years. According to insideBIGDATA human and machine generated data is experiencing an overall 10 times faster growth rate than traditional business data and machine data is increasing even more rapidly at 50 times the growth rate. While such proliferation has generated significant opportunities for example health care companies using big data to understand population health trends with big data come risks. If a company is seen to misuse or neglect the security of customer data it jeopardizes its reputation customer loyalty and market value as demonstrated by the drop in share price of an American social networking company and a multinational consumer credit reporting company when news emerged of data breaches and hacking. Meanwhile regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR have ushered in a tougher era for companies operating too close to the line. Our investments in the technology sector tend towards enterprise staples that are typically less exposed to direct consumer data risks. Regulatory and technological changes have made environmental and social concerns even more important than before. We would argue that a company s ability to deal with them effectively is central to quality management to governance and to sustaining high returns.

As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline.

      "Doc - Orig:  Our Portfolio Managers believe ESG factors matter for company results and will exclude a company based on our assessment of material ESG risks and how the company is handling them. Our ESG process is truly integrated and the final decision makers the portfolio managers lead the engagements. We provide a high level of transparency into our ESG process with detailed tracking of our engagements. We believe integrating information about ESG issues into our investment process makes us better investors and is consistent with our approach as long term growth managers in the emerging markets. ESG Integration into Our Investment Process As fundamental investors we seek out areas of growth and opportunity which we believe will last for the next 3 to 5 years and sustainable well run businesses which can capitalize on these trends. Our research process considers environmental social and governance issues that confront policymakers and company management because they matter for sustainable growth. Information we gather about the environmental social and governance issues faced by both country policymakers and company management teams helps us build a more complete picture of these investment opportunities and the potential risks involved. ESG is integrated throughout our investment process at both the company engagement level as well as in our top down country analysis. Our investment process integrates ESG analysis in a simple and repeatable way identifying and assessing material issues and engaging company management on these issues. Our Active Ownership Approach IDENTIFY AND ASSESS MATERIAL ESG ISSUES We identify the issues that are most material to the health of the business we are analyzing. We look by industry at the issues most directly linked to key business drivers for each company for example resource efficiency in heavy industries working conditions in labor intensive sectors and talent attraction and retention in intellectual property based industries. We have access to several different ESG resources which help our understanding of the key ESG issues including the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing MSCI ESG ratings and research and sell side ESG research and the company s own disclosure on corporate social responsibility. While we draw on these external resources rather than simply relying on a third party rating we focus on understanding the issues raised by these providers and conducting our own analysis on these issues and the companies accompanying strategy. We ultimately form our own independent judgment based on our analysis and engagement with management. ENGAGE WITH COMPANIES Our portfolio managers travel widely meeting with company management as part of our due diligence process. During these meetings we engage management with questions on the most pressing ESG issues facing their business. These conversations often give us information we need to focus on and dig deeper in later meetings. Over time we have found increasing management interest in ESG issues especially when ESG can be tied directly to the company s financial outlook. We also support good corporate governance through proxy voting and will vote against board recommendations we do not perceive to be in the best interests of shareholders. TOP DOWN COUNTRY ANALYSIS ESG factors are deeply embedded in Our Rules of the Road framework for identifying economies with a promising growth trajectory. The rules assist in measuring balance across the cycles from politics to credit investment and market sentiment that shape economic growth. ESG factors can and do play an important role in tipping these balances. As long term investors we firmly believe that a strong system for monitoring ESG in emerging markets helps us stay alert to the risks and opportunities of our company holdings for the long haul.

      "Doc - Orig:  As environmental social and governance ESG factors become more broadly incorporated into investment decision making sovereign fixed income investors are grappling with the best way to benchmark and quantify these factors across a diverse group of countries. While some may use a simple approach of investing in countries with the highest third party ESG ratings we disagree. Instead we think that this paint by numbers approach is systematically biased against developing countries where the potential for ESG improvement is arguably greater and would result in a pool of low yielding highly correlated and geographically concentrated countries. Morgan Stanley Investment Management has developed what we consider to be a better approach. Morgan Stanley Investment Management MSIM has developed a framework for benchmarking sovereign ESG performance that allows investment teams to quantify and compare ESG factors across the entire array of emerging and developed markets from Papua New Guinea to Portugal. By correcting for income per capita and adding an MSIM analyst driven momentum factor our approach seeks to reward positive changes from countries with the greatest opportunity for ESG improvements. The result presents genuine opportunities for yield and diversification in portfolios in a manner consistent with ESG and sustainability goals. This broad approach is a powerful component in our toolkit for integrating ESG factors into sovereign investing. Why unadjusted third party ESG ratings miss the mark We use the underlying environmental social and governance scores from MSCI as the basis for our benchmarking framework. The advantage of third party ratings is that they provide a quantifiable measure using standardized methodology that covers nearly every country in the world even the smallest frontier market bond issuers. However we think that simply applying unadjusted third party ESG ratings misses the mark. First a sovereign ESG benchmarking strategy that relies on unadjusted ESG scores is systematically biased against developing countries where the potential for ESG improvements is greater. As shown in Display 1 a country s level of wealth has explained nearly 60% of the variation in MSCI s aggregate ESG scores.1 The direction of causality between wealth and ESG scores likely runs in both directions. Improvements in ESG factors may contribute to a better growth environment causing wealth to increase. In the other direction rich countries have more resources to spend on improvements in ESG factors. DISPLAY 1 Wealth has explained nearly 60% of the variation of MSCI s ESG scores The index performance is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of a specific investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See Disclosure section for index definitions. Source IMF MSCI MSIM. Data as of July 2019. Another useful lens through which to examine this problem is the top decile of investable countries2 with the highest MSCI aggregate ESG scores. Of the 12 countries in the top 10% of highest unadjusted ESG scores all are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which The Economist often refers to as a club of mostly rich countries. 3 All of the countries are in the top two deciles of global wealth and five are in the top decile. There is also a problem of geographic concentration as 9 of the 12 countries are in Western Europe.4 Given the level of wealth and resources in these countries their bond markets are very low yielding when compared to the global opportunity set and display a high degree of correlation. A Better Way The MSIM Approach The MSIM approach rewards countries for positive ESG progress by incorporating timely expert judgment and corrects for the systematic bias against developing countries by controlling for a country s level of wealth. The result is a framework for quantifying ESG performance that we believe is more aligned with investors sustainability goals but also provides for genuine diversification5 and opportunities. MSIM sovereign ESG scores start with the underlying environmental social and governance scores provided by third parties. While our past research has primarily linked changes in governance to changes in asset prices we choose to equally weight the environmental social and governance scores for two reasons.6 First we believe that this simple approach best fits investors desire to incorporate a more holistic sustainability factor into the investment process. Second we have increased the weighting of the environmental score from 25% because the social and governance factors are so highly correlated with each other that we believe it makes sense to decrease their collective weight.7 Since we prioritize change at the margin for ESG factors we adjust scores by a momentum factor. This factor consists of two parts. The first part is provided by a third party and is based on momentum in the existing data. The second part is a momentum factor based on an MSIM sovereign analyst s subjective analysis of the environmental social and governance developments in a country over the past 12 18 months. This is important both because we believe that change at the margin is often what moves asset prices and the underlying data used by third parties often comes with a significant lag.8 These analyst provided momentum scores can help incorporate key changes in a timelier manner as well as allow for flexibility to incorporate expert views about the issues that matter in a given country that may not be fully reflected in the scoring methodology. Finally because sovereign ESG scores have been so highly correlated with a country s level of wealth we normalize by GDP per capita using linear regression. The result is a score that allows us to quantitatively benchmark countries against their incomepredicted ESG performance. This approach has three key advantages in our opinion. The first is broad comparability. Portfolios may contain bonds from a wide array of sovereign issuers and this framework affords the investment teams a consistent basis for benchmarking emerging and developed markets. Second we believe there is a compelling sustainability and practical argument for using a framework that rewards improvements in ESG factors even if coming from a low base as is the case with most developing nations. Third the MSIM approach results in a much more interesting and diverse opportunity set. As illustrated in Display 2 the top decile using the MSIM framework is a geographically diverse group of emerging and developed markets an important contrast to the geographically concentrated group of wealthy countries using the unadjusted ESG scores. This presents genuine opportunities for yield and diversification in portfolios in a manner consistent with ESG and sustainability goals. DISPLAY 2 Comparison of Top Decile ESG ratings are not intended as a recommendation and are subject to change. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings do not remove the risk of loss. Conclusions MSIM s sovereign ESG benchmarking framework is a helpful tool in a broader ESG toolkit. It allows investment teams to quantify and compare sovereign ESG performance on a portfolio level. It informs but does not dictate the decision making process. By controlling for wealth and incorporating a momentum factor it rewards ESG improvements by countries with greater scope for such improvements. We continue to develop and enhance our sovereign ESG toolkit. While the advantage of this benchmarking framework is its broad scope our emerging and developed market investment teams continue to explore new alternative data sources that can help us achieve our goal of capturing greater real time changes in ESG momentum that will better inform portfolio decisionmaking and asset price modeling. \n",

environmental social and governance score for two reasons.6 first believe that this simple approach best fit investor desire to incorporate a more holistic sustainability factor into the investment process . second have increase the weighting of the environmental score from 25 % because the social and governance factor be so highly correlate with each other that believe make sense to decrease collective weight.7 since prioritize change at the margin for esg factor adjust score by a momentum factor . this factor consist of two part . the first part be provide by a third party and be base on momentum in the exist datum . the second part be a momentum factor base on an msim sovereign analyst s subjective analysis of the environmental social and governance development in a country over the past 12 18 month . this be important both because believe that change at the margin be often what move asset price and the underlie datum use by third party often come with a significant lag.8 these analyst provide momentum score can help incorporate key change in a timely manner as well as allow for flexibility to incorporate expert view about the issue that matter in a give country that may not be fully reflect in the scoring methodology . finally because sovereign esg score have be so highly correlate with a country s level of wealth normalize by gdp per caput use linear regression . the result be a score that allow to quantitatively benchmark country against incomepredicte esg performance . this approach have three key advantage in opinion . the first be broad comparability . portfolio may contain bond from a wide array of sovereign issuer and this framework afford the investment team a consistent basis for benchmarke emerge and develop market . second believe there be a compelling sustainability and practical argument for use a framework that reward improvement in esg factor even if come from a low base as be the case with most develop nation . third the msim approach result in a much more interesting and diverse opportunity set . as illustrate in display 2 the top decile use the msim framework be a geographically diverse group of emerge and develop market an important contrast to the geographically concentrated group of wealthy country use the unadjusted esg score . this present genuine opportunity for yield and diversification in portfolio in a manner consistent with esg and sustainability goal . display 2 comparison of top decile esg rating be not intend as a recommendation and be subject to change . rating be relative and subjective and be not absolute standard of quality . rating do not remove the risk of loss . conclusion msim s sovereign esg benchmarking framework be a helpful tool in a broad esg toolkit . allow investment team to quantify and compare sovereign esg performance on a portfolio level . inform but do not dictate the decision make process . by control for wealth and incorporate a momentum factor reward esg improvement by country with great scope for such improvement . continue to develop and enhance sovereign esg toolkit . while the advantage of this benchmarke framework be broad scope emerge and develop market investment team continue to explore new alternative datum source that can help achieve goal of capture great real time change in esg momentum that will better inform portfolio decisionmaking and asset price modeling .\n",

ESG and the Sustainability of Competitive Advantage The Global Opportunity team s investment process integrates analysis of sustainability with respect to disruptive change financial strength and environmental and social externalities and governance also referred to as ESG . We view ESG as a component of quality and consider the valuation sustainability and fundamental risks inherent in every portfolio position. As bottom up investors we do not apply top down ESG positive negative screens to a benchmark. Nor do we utilize ESG scorecards from third parties which rank companies versus industry peers. In other words ESG in isolation is not a principal driver of our investment thesis it is but one component of our quality assessment. Our ESG analysis focuses on a company s ability to sustain competitive advantage over the long term. Areas assessed include environmental management to minimize externalities reduce consumption of energy water and other resources and mitigate costs thereby improving profitability social factors such as consumer product safety human capital management supply chain management and regulatory impacts and governance issues such as management incentives capital allocation independent boards and transparent accounting. Within the emerging markets where rule of law and corporate governance standards can be lower than developed markets additional due diligence steps are necessary. Risks stemming from corruption political instability governance and accounting issues must be thoroughly investigated. For every emerging market company we typically commission a full due diligence report including a background check on company management board directors and cross holdings court and tax filings and local language press to assess governance risk. Incorporating ESG related potential risks and opportunities within an investment process is about ensuring long term stewardship of capital. Over extended time horizons we believe that ESG risks are more likely to materialize and externalities not borne by the company are more likely to be priced into the value of securities. Therefore we continue to innovate and evolve our process and believe that integrating ESG within our investment analysis improves the risk and reward profile of client portfolios.

      "Doc - Orig:  A holistic approach to sustainability with respect to disruptive change financial strength environmental and social externalities and governance ESG helps us identify investment opportunities. ESG is a Component of Quality We believe that ESG factors are integral to assessing the quality of a company and thus are a vital part of our investment process. When we formulate our investment thesis on the quality of a company we ask three key questions1 to determine the sustainability of competitive advantage and how it can be monetized through growth Is the company a disruptor or is it insulated from disruptive change Does the company demonstrate financial strength with high returns on invested capital high margins strong cash conversion low capital intensity and low leverage Are there environmental or social externalities not borne by the company or governance and accounting risks that may alter the investment thesis ESG FACTORS MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT INVESTMENT RISK AND REWARD. Companies are increasingly confronted with environmental issues social factors and relationships with regulators and the communities in which they operate. In this context managing ESG factors is simply part of sustaining competitive advantage in today s economy. ESG EXTERNALITIES MAY NOT BE NOT FULLY PRICED INTO THE VALUE OF COMPANIES. When companies externalize the price of environmental and social issues upon the communities in which they operate they are by definition over monetized earning excess profits because the costs of externalities are not borne by the company. Investors risk paying the price when such excess is corrected and environmental and social costs are internalized to the company income statement. ESG RISK EVENTS HAVE MATERIALLY DETRACTED FROM PERFORMANCE. In recent years shareholders have suffered substantial losses following ESG risk events while there is no silver bullet to avoid such catastrophes we believe that incorporating ESG analysis can mitigate these risks. Our Quality Assessment of Companies Has Always Incorporated Governance Long Term Ownership Mindset We seek to own big ideas that win over time. Over extended time horizons we believe that ESG risks are more likely to materialize and externalities are more likely to be priced into the value of securities. Therefore we continue to innovate and evolve our process and believe that integrating ESG within our investment analysis improves the investment risk and reward profile of client portfolios. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Comparing apples to oranges Specialist research on environmental social and governance ESG factors can be useful. But we find that data providers such as MSCI ESG and Sustainalytics are sector relative and subjective on the materiality of ESG related risks or opportunities. This information may serve as inputs into our analysis but it doesn t drive our stock selection. When we identify potential risks that threaten the sustainability of returns we contact senior management directly. We engage with managements and the boards of companies across our portfolios including those in Global Sustain. On a case by case basis we discuss material ESG factors that could impact sustainable high returns on capital. These could include issues that may help ensure companies remain relevant with customers improve employee engagement and stay on the right side of governments and regulators. These factors could include where relevant environmental issues such as carbon emissions raw material sourcing and packaging. They may also include social issues such as supply chain labour standards or product quality. We review ESG information from data providers but only as a supplement to our own research Richest ESG research comes from direct engagement Many years of investing have shown us the world is grey not black or white meaning that over time companies can have environmental social or governance issues in a variety of types and magnitudes. Their severity and plans for resolution are key. We look to see sensible solutions and monitor progress on issues over time. To succeed in this effort requires more than data driven ESG scoring. We review ESG information from data providers the most useful of which is a compiled history of a company s controversies but only as a supplement to our own research. Understanding management quality requires direct engagement with company management. This is so important that for over 20 years we have engaged directly with companies on all kinds of material issues assisted where relevant by our firm s global stewardship team. Sector relative scoring has shortfalls One of the challenges of ESG risks is that by their nature they can be unexpected with potentially enormous consequences. Examples include oil spills or product recalls. Certain industries have inherent risks but even with these known risks it can be extremely difficult to assess the investment implications of unexpected low frequency high impact events before they occur. Quantitative scoring systems do not offer sufficient perspective for assessing the likelihood of such events. Through engagement we seek to mitigate these risks by understanding the priorities of a company s management. While the scores in individual areas from MSCI and Sustainalytics may point out areas to study we are wary of scoring that evaluates companies relative to their sector and industry peers rather than on an absolute basis inclusive of all industries. The problem with evaluating companies versus its sector peers is that if a software company scores unfavourably versus other software companies it may end up with a worse environmental score than a mining company that scores favourable versus other miners on environmental issues. This makes little sense to us. In addition we find many of the scores fairly unconvincing as they can depend more on the corporate s engagement with the process of measurement than with the underlying issue. We do not select companies based on their scores. The ultimate score is whether the company is a sustainable compounder More fundamentally the ultimate measure of sustainability is the long term success of the company. We believe that good environmental and social behaviour brings financial rewards over our long term investment horizon.

      "Doc - Orig:  Very few companies make the grade to be included in the Global Sustain portfolio in our view one of the highest quality ESG integrated portfolios available to investors. We only invest in businesses we believe can generate high sustainable future returns on operating capital. These high quality companies are extraordinarily rare. The resulting Global Sustain portfolio compares favorably to ESG peers in terms of two key quality metrics margin stability and returns on operating capital Quality It s all about sustainability of returns We explicitly exclude capital intensive low return companies because they are unable to sustain high returns on operating capital. Energy and materials companies for example are too cyclical to meet our requirements. Even utilities which are less cyclical fail to generate sufficient returns on capital due to their massive amounts of capital and equipment. Instead we target high return on capital non cyclical companies with pricing power. Many are found in the technology health care and consumer oriented sectors which tend to pollute less. We believe Global Sustain is therefore an inherently low carbon portfolio. Its carbon footprint is less than 30% of the MSCI World Index left chart . Carbon intensity scores however do not drive our security selection. We first screen the universe for high quality companies with attractive valuations. As part of our fundamental research and engagement with companies we consider on a case by case basis where appropriate material environmental or social or governance issues that have the potential to either enhance or disrupt a company s sustainability of returns. These issues include energy sources for data centers the sustainability of supply chains packaging for fast moving consumer goods companies consumer relevance data privacy security and product quality. A portfolio that avoids controversial sectors Global Sustain is tobacco free alcohol free and free of fossil fuels. The most capital intensive sectors commodities fossil fuels utilities and weapons are naturally excluded because they are too cyclical to meet our criteria. The resulting Global Sustain portfolio compares favorably to ESG peers in terms of two key quality metrics margin stability and returns on operating capital right chart . Source Factset MSCI ESG Morgan Stanley Investment Management as of December 31 2018. 1 MSCI ESG Research defines a portfolio s carbon footprint as the carbon emissions Scope 1 and 2 of a portfolio per million dollars invested. They sum up all the emissions in a portfolio based on the investor s ownership share using reported or estimated emissions data. 2 ROOCE Return Operating Capital Employed EBITA Earnings Before Interest Taxes and Amortization PPE Property Plant Equipment Trade Working Capital excludes goodwill . ex Financials. Margin Stability is based on earnings before interest and taxes and is calculated using this formula 1 std deviation mean . 10 year averages to December 31 2018. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk . \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Instant global communication and the immediacy of social media can leave a company s reputation in tatters within hours. For this reason we believe it is important to identify and understand any material reputational issues including environmental and social that might impact the sustainability and direction of future returns for the companies in which we invest. We focus on factors that may materially influence the sustainability and direction of future returns which is why scrutiny of material ESG risks and opportunities is fully integrated into our investment process. As we explained previously in ESG Scores Comparing Apples to Oranges we do not use scores to determine potential ESG considerations but prefer to consider each company and any environmental or social factors individually as part of our fundamental stock selection process. We believe the key is to concentrate on material risks that can have a significant impact on the fortunes of the company. While we take a bottom up approach to assessing companies there are common issues that we see within sectors. PRICING MATTERS An obvious material concern in the health care sector for example is U.S. drug pricing which has captured the headlines and been used as a campaign tool. Even though prescription drugs account for only 10% of U.S. health care expenditure politicians have seized upon the issue amplifying the social consequences for companies.1 We monitor the risk of negative headlines about drug prices for the health care sector and individual companies within it. There are some health care companies notably high quality medical equipment companies that have managed to sustain high returns on capital without relying on excessive pricing. Big data for example is emerging as an effective way to help hospitals to reduce costs by understanding population health trends. On the other hand this increases the risk of data security issues. PRIVACY PLEASE Portfolios aiming to grow capital and reduce downside participation need to tread carefully along the fault lines of digital ethics. Rapid data driven technological change is transforming how we live and work. Should governments eventually decide to seriously curb the flow and use of personal data due to political and social concerns fake news and election meddling social media smartphone addiction privacy this would damage business models reliant on monetizing it see a certain social media giant s problems with U.S. Congress the U.K. government and the European Union EU . Fines for breaches of data privacy can hurt companies in any sector but primarily in information technology health care and financials e.g. health insurance . The EU s GDPR regulation has exponentially increased potential fines especially for highly sensitive data like health records. Companies could be caught unprepared for this completely new risk. Additionally bigger companies represent a bigger threat surface for cyberattacks unless they invest. However this could present an opportunity for large cloud providers if they can prove to clients that data security in the cloud is better than in on premise storage. The security of customer data held by corporations privacy issues relating to how data is being monetized and cyberthreats are leading to increased spending on security software. These evolving trends will open up new markets new risks and potential opportunities. We invest in companies that we believe are more likely to benefit from these material opportunities and avoid those who rely on the monetization of data as the driver of revenues. CHANGING TASTES CHANGING FORTUNES We avoid owning consumer staples companies where management is failing to position their firms for future consumer demand for example U.S. food companies. As an industry food manufacturers face multiple and fast changing challenges. If management is short sighted about changing tastes then their company will struggle. Take the increased interest in healthy eating and the desire for food with recognizable more natural ingredients. This has led to consumers concentrating their shopping on the outer aisles of supermarkets where the fresh natural and whole foods are stored and avoiding the middle aisles that are home to more processed food items. Failure to adapt resulted in the top 25 U.S. food and beverage companies losing $18 billion in market share over a five year period according to Fortune 2015 . We want to understand the return drivers behind every stock we own. When we discover issues that are material especially when they have knock on effects that could jeopardize the sustainability of a company s long term returns on operating capital we look deeper and we engage. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies.

The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Spotlight on Incentives Given our long history of investor led engagement with companies on the subject of pay we have identified certain compensation scheme practices such as earnings adjustments that we believe to be red flags. We are wary of incentive schemes that rely too heavily on earnings per share EPS as an evaluation metric. If management are getting paid on EPS it can be tempting to manipulate those earnings using short term tactics such as increasing debt or making unwise acquisitions at the expense of shareholders long term returns. We are equally sceptical about compensation based on adjusted earnings the adjustment meaning that things such as write offs costs associated with environmental blunders or the decision to cover expenses by issuing shares aren t taken into account when pay is being decided. No wonder we tend to refer to them as earnings before the bad stuff. There are other compensation scheme tactics we prefer to avoid. We try to steer clear of companies that award high pay for ordinary or poor performance. Time served or the ability to show up every day is not a good enough reason to award shares in our opinion. Moving performance goal posts to suit current circumstances is also frowned upon. For example a global company with exposure to multiple currencies choosing to reward management when currency movements boost earnings but ignoring or discounting any negative effects of currency moves. ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS What we prefer to see in the companies we invest in are clear ambitious goals that are aligned with shareholder interests. We like to see management compensated for achieving return on capital targets and regularly engage to encourage this. Our engagement has resulted in such practices being adopted in a number of the companies that we invest in. We support minimum levels of management share ownership and actively engage to encourage such ownership requirements stay in place for a period after executives retire. Having such an arrangement in place prevents any temptation to inflate results in an unsustainable manner ensuring a high payout for the executive on exit but damaging long term shareholder returns. THE PAY X RAY Every company pay scheme is different so we created the pay x ray to provide a more level playing field. Using a proprietary scoring mechanism we can compare the pay plans of all of the companies we invest in and make decisions on those we will vote in support of and those we won t. In addition the pay x ray creates discussion within the investment team as well as highlighting specific issues for engagement. Our Engage report published twice yearly provides examples of this in action. In a deeply imperfect world we do not want our search for perfect to get in the way of the reasonable especially if our pay x ray shows the reasonable is improving year on year. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Plastic is high on the corporate agenda. We reviewed our holdings to evaluate how this topical issue might influence the sustainability of company returns on operating capital which is how we assess material risks and opportunities on any environmental social and governance ESG issue. We believe that by addressing their plastic consumption companies not only benefit the environment but also create opportunities to differentiate themselves. The world is drowning in plastic. A 2016 report The New Plastics Economy Rethinking the future of plastics by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that based on current trends there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish come 2050. Around half of the total plastic produced is used for consumer goods packaging usually single use and very little is recycled whether due to economic or technical reasons. We believe taxes on plastic packaging including outright taxes on virgin plastic higher waste processing fees and the introduction of deposit return fees may all have a material effect on consumer staples companies in the future unless they manage to adapt. In terms of cost we have identified two main ways in which plastic may impact fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies in addition to reputation or brand damage. Around half of the total plastic produced is used for consumer goods packaging and very little is recycled I PLASTIC TAXES AND REGULATION The aim of a plastic tax is not to raise revenues or reduce plastic use but to encourage an increase in recycled content e.g. a tax is levied on any packaging with less than 30% recycled content. We would anticipate any such tax being large enough to be noticed by packaging manufacturers with their low margins and their FMCG clients but not so large that it would hurt final consumer demand if passed on. The tightening of extended producer responsibility EPR rules would have a similar impact to the introduction of a tax. EPR means that companies producing any kind of waste have to pay the costs of dealing with it. The most comprehensive scheme is in Germany where brand owners are compelled by law to pay 100% of the net cost.1 Meanwhile in the U.K. the system only covers about 10% of the cost although this is currently being reformed.2 The European Union EU too is reviewing EPR requirements across the bloc. To quantify the effect we calculated the potential cost impact of such a scheme on an American beverage company we own. Should the whole world move to the German model it would cost this company 4% of sales while a move to the average EU cost would have an impact of 1% of sales. Strong consumer brands have significant pricing power and have historically managed to pass a substantial proportion of their input cost inflation on to their customers. We believe this would also apply to plastic. Similar to raw material inflation if regulation increases companies costs every company in a given country will be impacted similarly and will likely try to pass cost increases onto consumers. Given low price elasticity in consumer staples we believe the volume impact of such industry wide price increases would be limited. II INCREASED COST OF RECYCLED MATERIAL There are over 400 signatories to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment representing over 20% of global plastic packaging use. Their aggregate commitments to increase recycled content amount to five million tonnes of additional demand for recyclate by 2025 compared to current market demand of what we calculate to be around three and a half million tonnes. Such a significant increase in demand may in the medium term push the premium up until enough capacity comes on stream. Key issues are plastic taxes the increased use and cost of recycled plastic and brand impact ENGAGING ON PLASTIC With consumers ever savvier about responsible corporate behaviour our engagements with the FMCG companies we invest in show they are taking plastic waste seriously and in preparation for the upcoming impact of stricter regulation and plastic taxes have dramatically increased their commitments to virgin plastic reduction. Plastic may not currently represent a material risk to the sustainability of returns of consumer staples companies but the potential of it doing so in the future not to mention reputational damage is too high to dismiss. As we detail in our Engage report we met with eight of our FMCG holdings including those in beverages and household and personal care on plastic waste. As well as an important environmental issue plastic waste may impact the reputation and cost base of those who fail to adapt to the future reality of the new circular economy. Our engagements with the companies we invest in show they are taking plastic waste seriously. Although the single use plastic problem is very complex and will not be solved overnight most of our holdings which are among the largest consumer staples companies are likely to lead the rest of the FMCG industry in terms of focus allocated resources and public commitments to reduce plastic waste. Although meeting these commitments may result in somewhat higher costs in the near term they are manageable and should protect the companies from potentially elevated risks including increased regulation such as taxes on virgin plastic higher waste management costs or plastic bans. Our engagements with the companies we invest in show they are taking plastic waste seriously There is no single solution to the single use plastics problem given the sheer scale of virgin plastic production and society s dependence on it. Every possible avenue of improvement should be pursued. We believe solutions should involve governments and consumers as well as companies. During our engagements we discussed company specific strategies and targets as well as the hurdles to achieving them. Most of our consumer holdings have now publicly committed to significantly increase recycled content in their plastic packaging In the case of FMCG companies the most practical near term solution is increasing the percentage of recycled content in their packaging. This should increase demand for recycled plastic and encourage badly needed investments in the collection and recycling infrastructure. As part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation s Global Commitment most of our consumer holdings exposed to plastic packaging have now publicly committed to significantly increase recycled content from less than 10% in most cases to 20 50% by 2025. Although this will definitely not solve the problem by itself the largest FMCG user of plastic accounts for only about 2% of global plastic packaging volumes it should protect these companies from future regulatory risks such as potential taxes on virgin plastic the U.K. was the first country to announce one or reputational damage if consumers eventually start penalising brands they view as not addressing the problem. These incremental commitments should provide a material demand boost for the currently small recycled plastic market. Other initiatives undertaken by our holdings include partnerships with and investments into innovative start ups that explore breakthrough technologies in chemical recycling work on circular refillable packaging or try to find new ways to improve plastic waste capture in emerging markets. They also continue to work on simplifying and reducing the weight of their packaging and increasing its recyclability which already ranges between 70 100% in most cases . We encouraged the management of one of the beverage companies we hold to allocate a greater proportion of their sizeable annual charity donations towards projects related to tackling plastic waste in emerging markets. The company shared with us that it was already in their plans we will monitor future developments. As part of our engagement and research we tried to assess the cost impact of this move to a more sustainable circular plastic supply chain. Despite the potential temporary increase in prices of recycled plastic due to higher demand we believe that the cumulative impact is likely to be limited to a low single digit percentage of sales. Another finding was that more companies are starting to use circular plastic as a marketing tool by converting certain brands packaging to 100% recycled plastic and advertising this on the pack and in the media. We believe this is important for the long term health of their brands as more consumers particularly younger ones make brand choices based on sustainability credentials. The best way to implement ESG is directly at a company level on a case by case basis engaging with management on the key issues of the day We have always focused on high quality companies with sustainable and high returns on operating capital because we believe this is the best way to compound shareholders wealth over the long term. Embedding ESG into our investment process is essential to this because it helps us identify any material risks or opportunities that could threaten or enhance these returns whether it is plastics or carbon or executive incentives to name but a few. We continue to believe that the best way to implement ESG is directly at a company level on a case by case basis engaging with management on the key issues of the day. In April 2019 Morgan Stanley launched its Plastic Waste Resolution committing to facilitate the prevention reduction and removal of 50 million metric tonnes of plastic waste from entering rivers oceans landscapes and landfills by 2030.

be around three and a half million tonne . such a significant increase in demand may in the medium term push the premium up until enough capacity come on stream . key issue be plastic taxis the increase use and cost of recycled plastic and brand impact engage on plastic with consumer ever savvier about responsible corporate behaviour engagement with the fmcg company invest in show be take plastic waste seriously and in preparation for the upcoming impact of strict regulation and plastic taxis have dramatically increase commitment to virgin plastic reduction . plastic may not currently represent a material risk to the sustainability of return of consumer staple company but the potential of do so in the future not to mention reputational damage be too high to dismiss . as detail in engage report meet with eight of fmcg holding include those in beverage and household and personal care on plastic waste . as well as an important environmental issue plastic waste may impact the reputation and cost base of those who fail to adapt to the future reality of the new circular economy . engagement with the company invest in show be take plastic waste seriously . although the single use plastic problem be very complex and will not be solve overnight most of holding which be among the large consumer staple company be likely to lead the rest of the fmcg industry in term of focus allocate resource and public commitment to reduce plastic waste . although meet these commitment may result in somewhat high cost in the near term be manageable and should protect the company from potentially elevated risk include increase regulation such as taxis on virgin plastic high waste management cost or plastic ban . engagement with the company invest in show be take plastic waste seriously there be no single solution to the single use plastic problem give the sheer scale of virgin plastic production and society s dependence on . every possible avenue of improvement should be pursue . believe solution should involve government and consumer as well as company . during engagement discuss company specific strategy and target as well as the hurdle to achieve . most of consumer holding have now publicly commit to significantly increase recycle content in plastic packaging in the case of fmcg company the most practical near term solution be increase the percentage of recycle content in packaging . this should increase demand for recycled plastic and encourage badly need investment in the collection and recycle infrastructure . as part of the ellen macarthur foundation s global commitment most of consumer holding expose to plastic packaging have now publicly commit to significantly increase recycle content from less than 10 % in most case to 20 50 % by 2025 . although this will definitely not solve the problem by the large fmcg user of plastic account for only about 2 % of global plastic packaging volume should protect these company from future regulatory risk such as potential taxis on virgin plastic the u.k. be the first country to announce one or reputational damage if consumer eventually start penalise brand view as not address the problem . these incremental commitment should provide a material demand boost for the currently small recycled plastic market . other initiative undertake by holding include partnership with and investment into innovative start up that explore breakthrough technology in chemical recycling work on circular refillable packaging or try to find new way to improve plastic waste capture in emerge market . also continue to work on simplify and reduce the weight of packaging and increase recyclability which already range between 70 100 % in most case . encourage the management of one of the beverage company hold to allocate a great proportion of sizeable annual charity donation towards project relate to tackle plastic waste in emerge market . the company share with that be already in plan will monitor future development . as part of engagement and research try to assess the cost impact of this move to a more sustainable circular plastic supply chain . despite the potential temporary increase in price of recycle plastic due to high demand believe that the cumulative impact be likely to be limit to a low single digit percentage of sale . another finding be that more company be start to use circular plastic as a marketing tool by convert certain brand packaging to 100 % recycle plastic and advertise this on the pack and in the medium . believe this be important for the long term health of brand as more consumer particularly young one make brand choice base on sustainability credential . the good way to implement esg be directly at a company level on a case by case basis engage with management on the key issue of the day have always focus on high quality company with sustainable and high return on operate capital because believe this be the good way to compound shareholder wealth over the long term . embed esg into investment process be essential to this because help identify any material risk or opportunity that could threaten or enhance these return whether be plastic or carbon or executive incentive to name but a few . continue to believe that the good way to implement esg be directly at a company level on a case by case basis engage with management on the key issue of the day . in april 2019 morgan stanley launch plastic waste resolution commit to facilitate the prevention reduction and removal of 50 million metric tonne of plastic waste from enter river oceans

Of the $22.8 trillion invested sustainably or $1 in every $4 under professional management institutional investors own nearly 75%.1 The momentum for sustainable investing is high and asset owners are speaking louder than ever. In Japan the Government Pension Investment Fund the world s largest pension with $1.3 trillion under management announced last year that it would increase the ESG allocation of its equity holdings from 3% to 10%.2 Meanwhile New York City announced in January 2018 that it would divest its $189 billion public pension fund from fossil fuels in the next five years.3 Beyond pensions other asset owners including foundations are rising to the occasion as well. In April 2017 the Ford Foundation announced a commitment of $1 billion of its endowment to mission related investments.4 A recent survey from the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing and Morgan Stanley Investment Management finds continued growth and ample opportunity ahead. The survey which gathered insights from 118 global asset owners 60% of which had assets over $10 billion finds that 84% are pursuing or actively considering pursuing ESG integration in their investment process.

      "Doc - Orig:  Taking plastic seriously Plastic is high on the corporate agenda. We looked at the companies within our portfolios to assess how this topical issue might influence their sustainability of returns on capital. We believe that by addressing their plastic consumption companies not only benefit the environment but also create opportunities to differentiate themselves. The world is drowning in plastic. A 2016 report The New Plastics Economy Rethinking the future of plastics by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that based on current trends there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish come 2050. Around half the total plastic produced is used for consumer goods packaging usually single use and very little is recycled whether due to economic or technical reasons. We believe taxes on plastic packaging including outright taxes on virgin plastic higher waste processing fees and the introduction of deposit return fees may all have a material effect on consumer staples companies in the future unless they manage to adapt. In terms of cost we have identified two main ways in which plastic may impact fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies in addition to reputation or brand damage. Plastic Taxes and Regulation The aim of a plastic tax is not to raise revenues or reduce plastic use but to encourage an increase in recycled content e.g. a tax is levied on any packaging with less than 30% recycled content. We would anticipate any such tax being large enough to be noticed by packaging manufacturers with their low margins and their FMCG clients but not so large that it would hurt final consumer demand if passed on. The tightening of extended producer responsibility EPR rules would have a similar impact to the introduction of a tax. EPR means that companies producing any kind of waste have to pay the costs of dealing with it. The most comprehensive scheme is in Germany where brand owners are compelled by law to pay 100% of the net cost. 1 Meanwhile in the U.K. the system only covers about 10% of the cost although this is currently being reformed. 2 The EU too is reviewing EPR requirements across the bloc. To quantify the effect we calculated the potential cost impact of such a scheme on an American beverage company we own. Should the whole world move to the German model it would cost this company 4% of sales while a move to the average EU cost would have an impact of 1% of sales. Strong consumer brands have significant pricing power and have historically managed to pass a substantial proportion of their input cost inflation to their customers. We believe this would also apply to plastic. Similar to raw material inflation if regulation increases companies costs every company in a given country will be impacted similarly and will likely try to pass cost increases onto consumers. Given low price elasticity in consumer staples we believe the volume impact of such industry wide price increases would be limited. Increased Cost of Recycled Material There are over 350 signatories to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment representing around 20% of global plastic packaging use. Their aggregate commitments to increase recycled content amount to five million tonnes of additional demand for recyclate by 2025 2030 compared to current market demand of what we calculate to be around three and a half million tonnes. Such a significant increase in demand may in the medium term push the premium up until enough capacity comes on stream. With consumers ever savvier about responsible corporate behavior our engagements with the FMCG companies we invest in show they are taking plastic waste seriously and in preparation for the upcoming impact of stricter regulation and plastic taxes have dramatically increased their commitments to virgin plastic reduction. Plastic may not currently represent a material risk to the sustainability of returns of consumer staples companies but the potential of it doing so in the future not to mention reputational damage is too high to dismiss. In April 2019 Morgan Stanley launched its Plastic Waste Resolution committing to facilitate the prevention reduction and removal of 50 million metric tonnes of plastic waste from rivers oceans landscapes and landfills by 2030. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. 1 Source LSE Research Online Packaging waste recycling in Europe is the industry paying for it Ferreira da Cruz et al. 2 Consultation on reforming the UK packaging producer responsibility system Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Responding to consumer demand A company s environmental and social policies can help drive its returns and manage risks. Companies that get it right differentiate themselves from competitors in the eyes of both consumers and their own employees. Those that don t can suffer reputational damage or punitive fines that undermine their ability to compound. Companies that get it right differentiate themselves from competitors Many companies in the consumer staples sector seize opportunities to produce innovative goods that consumers want. Examples include products less harmful to the environment healthier products or those that appeal to an emerging demographic. By pursuing these opportunities firms can increase market share or enhance their pricing power both of which preserve or improve profitability. INNOVATIONS IN PACKAGING A number of the consumer staples companies we own are committed to developing and producing consumer friendly environmentally responsible packaging improvements. While PET polyethylene terephthalate bottle recycling is spreading globally contamination caused by hard to remove sticky labels can reduce the quality and therefore usability of the end material. In an effort to encourage the growing circular economy a German chemical and consumer goods company that we own has developed certified removable labelling adhesives to ensure the highest recycled plastic quality. Another of our holdings a major American manufacturer of household products has worked closely with its suppliers to create innovative packaging that can be easily recycled while still meeting products needs. SUSTAINABLE SOURCING A French personal care company that we own uses renewable natural ingredients in its products. This has a triple effect good for the consumer good for the supply chain and good for those who typically cultivate the crops. For example the company sources Argan oil from Morocco shea butter from Burkino Fasa and galangal leaves from Vietnam. Most of the harvesting and processing of these ingredients is done by women. Acknowledging the harvesters many climate related challenges including water scarcity poor soil health and desertification the company has developed sustainable sourcing projects to help farmers overcome climate related risks and improve their livelihoods. In doing so this large cosmetic company is reducing the environmental footprint left by its primary cosmetic ingredients and protecting the supply sources of these ingredients in the future. It s a great example of stakeholder alignment. RECYCLING An American soft drink manufacturer that we own was in 1991 the first company to introduce plastic bottles with recycled content. 88% of their packaging and 100% of PET bottles is recyclable. They have invested heavily in recycling infrastructure the recycling plants built in Mexico have helped increase the rate of PET bottle recycling from 9% in 2002 to 60% today. By 2030 this company aims to recycle 100% of packaging used. An American manufacturer of household products that we own has partnered with the Sustainability Packaging Coalition to include How2Recycle labels on their North American packaging informing consumers how each package can be recycled. Over 20 billion padded mailers are used in e commerce packaging each year but bubble wrap mailers are not recyclable. A German consumer goods company has collaborated with key e commerce players to create a new generation of all paper padded mailers that can be recycled. Flexible pouches are used to package all sorts of consumables from coffee to dishwasher tablets but the layered nature of the packaging material means that the valuable aluminium within them is impossible to recover. Working in partnership with recycling companies and key flexible packaging manufacturers the same German company has created unique adhesives that enable the separation of layers at recycling facilities turning waste into value. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY The American beverage company we own has responded to increasing global interest in reduced sugar consumption by aggressively reformatting recipes to reduce sugar promoting low and no calorie beverage options and investing in systems to make smaller packages more available. As a result of this innovation in the 2017 2018 period the company removed 425 000 tonnes of sugar from its products. Another of our holdings a multinational consumer goods holding sets itself apart through its purpose led brands . The company launched its Sustainable Living Plan in 2010 which lays out three goals. By 2020 they aim to help more than a billion people take action to improve their health. By 2030 their goal is to halve the environmental footprint of their products. By 2020 they hope to enhance the livelihoods of millions of people. The plan includes eliminating deforestation from the commodity supply chain by 2020 establishing sustainable agriculture as a mainstream initiative and universal access to safe drinking water. In 2018 this company retained its top ranking in the Sustainability Leaders survey from GlobeScan SustainAbility for the eighth consecutive year. No other company has maintained top recognition for so long in the 20 year history of the survey. These are some of the common themes we are seeing in our global portfolios from companies with environmental and social policies that are driving both revenues and consumer satisfaction.

      "Doc - Orig:  Positive Science A number of the health care companies we own in our global portfolios report their contributions to UN Sustainable Development Goals UN SDGs as part of their annual reporting. While we don t seek out companies with an explicit ESG agenda or score in mind we welcome corporate engagement with the 17 UN SDGs and 169 specific targets. Here we discuss three of the UN SDGs most commonly supported by the health care companies we own Zero Hunger Goal 2 Good Health and Well Being Goal 3 and Clean Water and Sanitation Goal 6 Contemporary society demands that organizations operate with a sense of social and ethical responsibility and in the case of health care use science and technology to address health needs. ZERO HUNGER Two billion people are affected by micronutrient malnutrition half reside in countries where rice is a staple food. Fortifying rice can make a real difference to improving nutrition. Scientists at an American health care company we own are working with a nonprofit organization to improve rice fortification technology and have succeeded in both reducing costs and improving nutritional value. This rice is distributed as part of a school lunch program in India targeting 450 000 children and will be able to help many more in the future. The German multinational life sciences company we own has introduced high quality food for all as a central tenet of its sustainable development program. The company aims to help overcome the challenge of feeding an increasing number of people using increasingly scarce arable land using its innovation in seeds and in biological crop protection solutions. GOOD HEALTH AND WELL BEING The health care companies we own support SDG 3 by using science and technology to address health needs and by making their products affordable and available. A British multinational pharmaceutical company we own has trained over 21 000 health care professionals on responsible antibiotic use. The same company donated 8 billion tablets in 2017 to treat neglected tropical diseases and provided hundreds of millions of vaccines at heavily discounted rates to the world s least developed countries. The Kids and Diabetes in Schools KiDS Project run by another of our holdings a French biopharmaceutical company has reached more than 45 000 children and 4 400 teachers in Brazil Egypt India Japan Pakistan Poland and the United Arab Emirates. The project aims to foster a safe and supportive school environment for children with diabetes. A third holding an American medical technology company has a pipeline of products in development to help reduce maternal mortality and preventable newborn deaths while its technologies are integral to the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION The British pharmaceutical company we hold has robust controls in place to manage the risk of pharmaceuticals particularly antibiotics entering the environment via water pollution. The company works with its supply chain and peers to share best practices on managing environmental discharges. Meanwhile the American health care company we own supports SDG 6 by developing innovative products that can be used safely even when clean water is scarce supporting communities in water management and working to reduce its own water footprint. The UN SDGs present a useful framework for companies to help assess and improve their impact on the environment and on society. Our preference is for medical technology and animal health versus pharmaceuticals where government focus on affordable pricing presents challenges to pricing power. We don t select companies on their ESG credentials we do focus on companies sustainable long term returns. Through proactive social and environmental policies companies can work to safeguard their reputations and sustain their long term returns. RISK CONSIDERATIONS There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market value of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Changes in the worldwide economy consumer spending competition demographics and consumer preferences government regulation and economic conditions may adversely affect global franchise companies and may negatively impact the strategy to a greater extent than if the strategy s assets were invested in a wider variety of companies. In general equity securities values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic and market risks. Stocks of small capitalization companies carry special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Non diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility. Option writing strategy. Writing call options involves the risk that the Portfolio may be required to sell the underlying security or instrument or settle in cash an amount of equal value at a disadvantageous price or below the market price of such underlying security or instrument at the time the option is exercised. As the writer of a call option the Portfolio forgoes during the option s life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the underlying security or instrument covering the option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security or instrument decline. Additionally the Portfolio s call option writing strategy may not fully protect it against declines in the value of the market. There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the Portfolio to potentially significant loss. \n",

      "Doc - Orig:  Engaging the workforce Having an engaged workforce is extremely valuable. The software and services companies held in our global portfolios engage their employees by promoting responsible values and with initiatives that make a difference. Creating a sense of purpose around the role of the company above mere profitability can foster a culture of innovation and development help with engagement and even enhance productivity. A multinational professional services company we own seeks to embrace diversity in its business not just within its own workforce in 2018 they were ranked number one on Thomson Reuters Diversity and Inclusion Index for the third consecutive year but also in its supply chain. By the end of 2018 its Diverse Supplier Development Program had developed 144 small medium and diverse suppliers towards its target of 170 by 2020. Another one of our holdings a German multinational software company creates a culture of inclusion with its groundbreaking Autism at Work program integrating people with autism into the workforce where their skills add value. 93% of the company s employees acknowledge the importance of pursuing purpose and sustainability. The company s Corporate Social Responsibility CSR scheme has three main pillars building digital skills accelerating best run nonprofits and social enterprises and connecting employees with a purpose to help ensure everyone can participate in and benefit from the digital world. In 2018 its digital skills and coding programs trained 34 000 teachers engaged 2.8 million young people and spanned 93 countries. In addition environmental and charitable activities such as using GPS technology and in memory databases to preserve endangered elephants and rhinos all add to their employees sense of purpose. As too do the philanthropic efforts of an American multinational technology company which gives broadly to priority areas of education human services affordable housing and family friendly arts and culture. Further an American multinational financial services company we own focuses specifically on financial inclusion. It offers access to finance and is committed to collaborating with partner banks to provide bank accounts to 500 million people by 2020. They have reached 40 million people with their free financial literacy programs using their technology and global reach to provide free accessible and innovative financial education resources. When companies understand that social environmental and economic activities and performance are interlinked and reflect this in their culture it can strengthen employee engagement and have a positive impact on recruitment and retention.
